Abstract
Agroupissaidtobe pseudo-free if an adversary who is allowed to see group descrip-
tion, is unable to solve non-trivial equations. Non-trivial equations are the equations
that have no solution in a free group. The notion of pseudo-freeness was introduced by
Rivest, who left as a open problems whether such groups exists in cryptography or not.
Rivest’s conjecture that the RSA group is pseudo-free has been settled by Micciancio
for case of static adversary who is given only the group description and his goal is to
come up with an equation and solution.
Later on the notion of pseudo-freeness has been extended to adaptive adversary for
case of univariate equations by Dario.C, Dario.F and warinschi.B. In case of adaptive
pseudo-free groups, the adversary learns solutions of some non-trivial equations before
producing a new equation.
In this project we make extension to the notion of pseudo-free groups from univari-
ate to multivariate equations and system of equations in face of adaptive adversary.
In our setting along with the group description the adversary is allowed to see some
non-trivial equations with their solutions and ﬁnally his goal is to come up with new
non-trivial equation and solution.
First of all we show triviality for case of adaptive pseudo-free groups[page 30] and
then craft deﬁnitions with respect to multivariate equations[page 32] and system of
equations[page 42]. Therefore in this project we provide
• Formal deﬁnition of adaptive pseudo-free groups with multivariate equations and
system of equations
• Proof that the ”The RSA group is adaptive pseudo-free with respect to multivari-
ate equations”[page 32].2

1 Introduction
Most of the modern cryptography relies on di?culty of solving non trivial equations
over computational ﬁnite groups. Cryptography speculates pseudo-free groups as a
very strong and interesting notion. The notion of pseudo-free groups was ﬁrst intro-
duced by Hohenberger[18]. She presented an informal deﬁnition of such groups. She
used them to identify transitive signature schemes along with their variants and found
that the adversary cannot e?ciently compute their inversion[18]. After Hohenberger,
Rivest[31] polished this notion and extended it by deﬁning it formally. He considered
pseudo-free groups to be a strong notion and assumed that many other computational
assumptions[26] typically used in cryptography, like the hardness of computing discrete
logarithms, the RSA assumption and the strong RSA assumption holds the property of
pseudo-free groups. Subsequently D.Miccianico[26] proved the pseudo-freeness of the
RSA group under the strong RSA assumption for static adversary. He proved pseudo-
?
freenessofRSAgroup(Z )atleastwhenN =PQandistheproductoftwosafeprimes
N
such that P =2p+1and Q=2q +1. Here P,Q are safe (odd) primes and p,q are
known as Sophie German primes. Safe prime is a special type of prime numbers used in
cryptography. In his static setting[26], the adversary is allowed to see the description
of the group and ﬁnally his goal is to come up with some equation and solution to that
equation.
Informally, a computational group is considered to be pseudo-free if an adversary who
is allowed to see description of the group cannot e?ciently compute solutions for non-
trivial equations, whereasnon-trivial equationmeanstheequation whosesolution does
not exist in a free group. We give the formal description of pseudo-free groups in sec-
tion[3.4]. Free groups[26] are used in Dolev-Yao model for symbolic analysis of public
key cryptographic protocols. From past few years, a lot of study[26] have been carried
out to cover the gap between the symbolic Dolev- Yao model and standard computa-
tional model used in cryptography in order to achieve computational soundness results
for symbolic analysis methods. An important motivation to study pseudo-free groups
is to see whether it can be used to extend Dolev-Yao security model with cryptographic
functions that make use of such groups in cryptography and lead to many new appli-
cations. Other reasons for studying pseudo-free groups are as follows [31]:
- Proofs perhaps might be made easier with the use of stronger assumptions that in
turn incorporates many other common cryptographic assumptions like the hardness of
computing discrete logarithms and the strong RSA assumption
-Ifweassumethatagroupispseudo-freethenitmaypossiblyallowanevenwider
range of applications, as the strong RSA assumption has been very serviceable in the
construction of many cryptographic functions which are not acknowledged to be secure
under the standard version of the RSA assumption6
- There is no prevailing solution for speciﬁc cryptographic primitives, like directed
transitive signature schemes whose construction has been linked to Pseudo-freeness
In cryptography[9], Pseudo-free groups so far do not have so many applications and
the reason for this is that in most of the cases of RSA group, not only group’s de-
scription is provided to adversary but also he is given some equations and solutions.
Thus after learning solutions to some equations his goal is to output a new equation
along with its solution. For example as deﬁned in [9] such cases holds true for signa-
ture schemes based on RSA where adversary can output signature to solve equation
whose solution does not exist in a free group. Here the adversary can gain access to
an oracle through chosen message attack and generates forgery as a solution to new
non trivial equation. This problem was noticed by Rivest[31] who left the notion of
pseudo-freeness as an open problem and also mentioned, whether pseudo-free groups
exist in cryptography?.
1.1 Aims and Objectives
The main aim of the project is to explore the notion of pseudo-free groups with mul-
tivariate equations and system of equations to adaptive adversary. Pseudo-free groups
so far has been deﬁned for univariate and multivariate equations for static adversary
and univariate equations for adaptive adversary. In this project we extend this study
and identify pseudo-freeness with respect to an adversary who may learn solutions to
other non-trivial equations before solving a new non-trivial equation.
This project has follwing objectives:
• To deﬁne adaptive pseudo-freeness with respect to multivariate equations and
system of equations.
• To provide constructions that will show how RSA group satisﬁes our deﬁnitions.
The current deﬁnitions of pseudo-free groups are not su?cient to make use of such
groups in cryptography[26]. The reason is that an adversary[9] that interacts with
some cryptographic primitive built on top of a group may obtain additional informa-
tionnotavailabletohiminthegamethatdeﬁnespseudo-freeness. Thereforeweexplore
this notion with the intuition of getting much stronger version of pseudo-free groups..
Adaptive pseudo-freeness[9]: Informally in adaptive pseudo-free groups, the ad-
versary along with the group description is allowed to see some equations (that have
no solution in a free group) together with its solutions. Finally aim of adversary is to
come up with new non-trivial equation and solution.
In this project we explore the notion of adaptive pseudo-free groups and prove that
the RSA is adaptive pseudo-free. Our results in [5.5] holds for multivariate equations
but can easily extend to system of equations. The deﬁnition of pseudo-free groups in7
adaptive setting consists of two design decisions. The ﬁrst issue with the design is to
set equations for which an adversary can see solutions and the second issue is to deﬁne
what do we actually mean by non-trivial multivariate equations in adaptive setting of
pseudo-free groups. We ﬁrst deﬁne triviality[5.4,6.1] of equations and then craft a def-
inition of adaptive pseudo-free groups for case of multivariate equations[Deﬁnition 11]
and system of equations [Deﬁnition 13]. We detail our results next.
1.2 Structure
This report consist of six main sections. The ﬁrst section is devoted to introduce the
basic concept of pseudo-free groups with the motivation of why there is a need to study
such groups. Section two presents some preliminaries and mathematical background
which is necessary to understand the notion of pseudo-freeness. Section three describes
the formal deﬁnition of free groups and pseudo-free groups with the implication of such
groups to other strong cryptographic assumptions. Section four presents the formal
deﬁnition of static pseudo-free groups and shows that how RSA group satisﬁes this
deﬁnition in case of static adversary. Section ﬁve presents adaptive pseudo-free groups
and their applications. In this section we introduce our concept of adaptive pseudo-free
groupswithmultivariateequations. Firstofallweshowtrivialityincaseofmultivariate
equations and then craft deﬁnition out of them. Later in this section we prove that the
RSA is adaptive pseudo-free with multivariate equations. In Section six we extend the
notionofadaptivepseudo-freegroupsfrommultivariatetosystemofequations. Finally
in last two sections we discuss some open problems that have been investigated in the
notion of pseudo-freeness and as a future scope we show an idea of extracting a more
e?cient application out of these groups.8

2.2 Mathematical Background
Before we describe in detail the concept of pseudo-free Groups, we present some math-
ematic background which is closely related to notion of pseudo-free groups.
2.2.1 Deﬁnition 1 Group[31]-Amathematicalgroup G is deﬁned as a pair of
(S,o) where S is the set of elements and ’o’isanoperatoron S that satisﬁes the fol-
lowing properties.
• Closure-Thispropertystatesthatifthereexiststwoelements i,j that belongs

• Identity -Thispropertystatesthatifthereexistsanidentityelement e ? S

• Inverses - It states that for some element i ? S,there exists some other element
j ? S such that the following condition holds:
(ioj)=(ioj).9

The notation xy is same as x o y and as inverse is denoted by a .Thenotation x
?n ?1 ?1 ?1
means that the word (x,x,x,...,x)isoflength n and x is the word (x ,x ,...,x )
of length n.
2.2.2 Computational Groups
Informally, a mathematical group G has some representation [G]andsuchrepresen-
tations [G] are known as computational groups[31]. In cryptography these groups are
widely used and many other groups are based on the notion of such groups. For in-
stance if we deﬁne set G as a group then we can consider G as a computational group
[G]withidentity1.
Formally such groups are deﬁned as:
Deﬁnition 2[31]: A group is said to be computational group if it represents an under-
lying mathematical groupG=(S,o) and provides e?cient (polynomial time) algorithms
for each of the operations given below:
• Composition- It states that giving a representation of elements say [i],[j]that
belongs to computational group [G], compute representation of [i]o[j]
• Identity- Find representation of identity element e that belongs to [G]
?1
• Inverses-Given some element [i]thatbelongsto[G],ﬁnd [i ].
• Equality Testing-Itstatesthatongivingrepresentationoftwoelements[i][j]
that belongs to computational group[G],determine if i = j
• Sampling-(onlyifG is ﬁnite) returns representation [i]thatischosenuniformly
at random from [G]orinamannerthatissimilarfromuniformlyatrandom
to a probabilistic polynomial time adversary. Such a procedure is denoted as
[i]? [G].

2.2.3 Black Box Groups
Babai and Szemeredi introduced a notion- Black Box. This notion may be used by the
parties in cryptographic protocol to access the group. According to black box assump-
tion [31], each element of the computational group G is a bit string of some common
length N,andBlackBoxsubroutinesareavailableforthegroupoperations.
Only with the help of given implementations group operations can be performed. This
is Black Box assumption, in which the representation of group elements is opaque: op-
erations on them other than through the black box routines are forbidden.10
Naturally, one may be curious to enquire the possibility for having black box algo-
rithm for various group-theoretic problems. As the selections of the operations to be
performed during algorithm design is restricted, Black Box assumption results in self
imposed restrictions or conventions which are in turn favorable for algorithm design.
Various techniques are not required for ﬁnding an algorithm if we use black box as-
sumption as it itself gives satisfying result.
For example A probabilistic black box algorithm given by Tonelli nad shanks for ﬁnding
?
the square roots of Z .Thisalgorithmisusedtoﬁndrepresentationofanelement[x]
P
having value x on giving [a]and P such that:
2
x = a mod P
The black box assumption becomes restrictive if there does not exist any e?cient al-
gorithm to compute this. For example shoup has proved lower bounds for discrete
algorithm and other problems in discrete model.
However our priority for studying is cryptographic security not algorithmic e?ciency.
An adversary may check the code that implements group operations or test the bits of
any representation as it is likely for typical adversary to violate any black box assump-
tion willfully.
?
As an example likeZ where the adversary is allowed to seeN and a code for composi-
N
tion. Therefore the attacker can see the code or bit-level representation of elements by
usingtechniqueslikeindexmethodcalculuswhichisnotthereinblackboxassumption.
Thus, we do not consider black box assumptions. We assume by default that ad-
versary can access any obtainable information and also may use techniques which are
dependentonimplementationorrepresentationdetails. Non-black-boxadmissionofthe
adversary to the group implementation is thus considered universally. A representation
of a Computational groups allows one to decide whether a group is pseudo-free or not.
Therefore one can think like that if an equation has a solution in computational group
,thenonlythereexistsasolutionofthecorrespondingequationinamathematical
group.
2.3 Division intractable functions
Afunction H is said to be division intractable[9] if it is not possible for an adversary
to compute ({p ,...,p },q)suchthat q?=p for all (i=1ton)and H(q)divides H(p ).
1 n i i
The notion of division intractable functions was introduced by Gennaro et al. Any
function that maps input to prime numbers clearly satisﬁes the property of division
intractable functions.11
Deﬁnition 3 [9] - Division intractable functions
Let H denotes family of hashes having poly(h)-bit input and h-bit output. A func-
tion H is said to be division intractable if it is not possible for an adversary to compute
1) H is randomly chosen from H
2) Adversary produces ({p ,...,p },q) such that q?=p? (i = 1 to n) and H(q) divides
1 n i
H(p ).

3 Free Groups
Free groups are inﬁnite groups that are constructed from a given set of generators such
that there do not exist any non trivial relationship between them.
The formal deﬁnition of Free group[31] is as follows:
Deﬁnition 4: Let A = {a ,....,a } represents a non-empty set of distinct symbols
1 m
such that {a ,....,a } are known as generators of the free group. Let the inverse of
1 m
?1
?1
each symbol say a is given by a such that then A represents the non-empty set
i

?
?1 ?1 ?1
ˆ ˆ
{a ,....,a }. Let A denotes A A where as A is the set of symbols for the free
1 m
group .
Let the free group is denoted by F(A), it can also be written as F(a ,....,a )if A=
1 m
{a ,....,a }.Elementsinfreegroupscanbewrittenaswords.
1 m
For example the word below:
?1 ?1 ?1
a a a a a a a
1 3 3 4
1 2 3
is representing elements of F(a ,a ,a ,a )
1 2 3 4
Awordinafreegroupcanbereducedbyeliminatingtheadjacentinversesymbols.
?1
Therefore the word in the given above example can be reduced and written as a a .
4
2
Awordissaidtobeinreducedorcanonicalformifitcannotbereducedfurther. Thus
we can say that the words in canonical form are the elements of the free group.
The binary operation o in a free group is a concatenation followed by simpliﬁcation.
For example
?1 ?1 ?1 ?1 ?1
a a oa a = a a a a = a a .
1 2 1 2 2
3 1 3 1 3
An empty word is the identity of a free group. Two words in a free group represent the
same element if their canonical forms after simpliﬁcation are exactly same. The reverse
of the word is known as the inverse of the word.
3.1 Free Abelian Groups
A group is said to be free abelian group [31,19]if it is deﬁned in a same manner as a free
group. These groups are denoted asFA{a ,....,a } such that {a ,....,a } are known
1 m 1 m
as generators.
The reduced form of a word in free abelian group FA{a ,....,a } to a word of the
1 m
form :
s s s
1 2 3 s

a a a ....a

is deﬁned by commutativity whereas s ,s ,s ,...,s are integers.

and implement o with the vector addition.
3.2 Equations in Free Groups
The equations in free groups[31] are as follows:
Let ’F’ be a free group having a set of generators a ,a ,a ,...,a .Let x ,x ,x ,...,x
1 2 3 m 1 2 3 n
be variables in F.Thusanequationinfreegroup F can be written as:
w =w

where w and w represents the words formed from variables of F i.e. x ,x ,x ,...,x
1 2 1 2 3 n
and set of generators a ,a ,a ,...,a.Wecanalsowritetheseequationsinreduced
1 2 3 n
(canonical) form for some w.
For example an equation in F (a ,a )
1 2
?1

1 2 2
1
In free groups the equations that have solutions are known as satisﬁable equations
and the equations that do not have any solution are known as unsatisﬁable equations.
Makanin in 1982[24] showed that it is possible to ﬁnd whether an equation is satisﬁable
or unsatisﬁable in a free group. More recently Gutierrez in 2000[16] showed that the
above problem is possible in PSPACE.
When the free group is abelian groupFA(a ,a ,a ,...,a ), then one can ﬁnd whether
1 2 3 n
the equation has solution or not. The equation is always rewritten as:
e e e s s s
1 2 n 1 2 m
x x ...x =a a ...a
1 2 n 1 2 m
for integers e ,e ,,e and s ,s ,...,s .Theseequationsaresatisﬁableonlyif?i,1≤

AnequationwhichhassolutioninF(A)hasalsosolutioninFA(A)buttheconverse
is not always true. This is beneﬁcial because it gives an easy way to show that an
equation has no solution in a F(A)andmerelyprovethatithasnosolutioninFA(A).14
3.3 The correspondence
Pseudo-free groups considered to be a strong notion from cryptographic perspective
and many other cryptographic assumptions holds on to the notion of pseudo-freeness.
In each and every case one can ﬁnd its formulation interesting.
For example[31], for the below quadratic equation
2
x =a
there does not exist any solution in a free group because the canonical form ofx always
has even length where x is variable and a is the generator.
Thus the above equation has no solution in a free group, what does it mean for the
same equation in group G?
Incomputationalgroupstheremayexistsolutionsofnon-trivialequations. Forexample
?
there exist a solution of the above mentioned equation in Z such that.
N
2
x =a
has a trivial solution if one is given a = 4 then we can ﬁnd a clear solution as x=2.
The above problem can be solved if each of the generators say a must correspond
i
independently to a randomly generated element of G. As in [31], an adversary can
distinguish a group G from a free group if
(1)AnadversaryoutputsanequationE withvariablesx ,...,x andconstantsa ,...,a
1 n 1 m
that has no solution in a fre e group.
(2)An adversary come up with randomly chosen values a ,...,a and use them as con-
1 m
stants for the equation.
(3)An adversary suceessfully produce variables x ,...,x that satisﬁies the equation.
1 n
As per deﬁnition of pseudo-free groups, the adverary can selects equation by his own
as long as the equation has no solution in a free group. This generalize the situation
for the strong RSA assumption where the adversary can select the exponent.15
3.4 Pseudo-free Gropus
Morespeciﬁcally, acomputationalgroupissaidtobepseudo-freegroupifitisnotpos-
sible for an adversary who is given only the group description to produce an equation

because this equation is trivial and has solution over the free group if we put x = a

and x =a.

Deﬁnition 5[31,26].:- A family of computational groups G = G for N≥ 0 is said to
N
pseudo-free if all operations in G is performed in polynomial time in k. and for every
N
probabilistic polynomial time adversary A following holds. Let N? N be a randomly
k
chosen group index and deﬁne ?:A?G by choosing ?(a) at random in G for each
N N
a? A. Then the probability on giving (N,?) as input, the adversary outputs an equation
’E’ and solution ’S’ is almost negligible in k.
This deﬁnition belongs to the family of computational groups but we can apply this
deﬁnition to mathematical groups by understanding that the implementation of such
groups in some standard way as computational groups.
3.4.1 Types of pseudo-free groups
There are two types od pseudo-free groups which are as follows
(1) Static pseudo-free groups
(2) Adaptive pseudo-free groups
Static pseudo-free groups:-
Agroupissaidtobestaticpseudo-freeifanadversarywhoisallowedtoseedescription
of the group can not solve new nontrivial equation and solution.
Adaptive pseudo-free groups:-
In adaptive pseudo-free groups, along with group description an adversary is allowed
to see some non-trivial equations and solutions and ﬁnally his goal is to come up with
new non-trivial equation and solution.
3.5 Cryptographic assumptions holds on pseudo-free groups
There are six cryptographic assumptions[31] considered by Lipschutz and Miller that
are as follows:
• The order problem
• The power problem
• The root problem16
• The proper power problem
• The generalized power problem
• The intersection problem
LipschutzandMillerhasshownthattheabovementionedsixfundamentalproblemsare
independent i.e. for each pair of problems there exists a group such that one problem
has solution in a group where as other problem has no solution.
Rivest[31] has shown that the above six fundamental problems are intractable in
pseudo-freegroupssuchthatnoprobabilisticpolynomialtimeadversarycansolvethese
problems with non-negligible probability. On the other side, Rivest also left a very in-
teresting question whether or not the computational Di?e-Hellman problem (CDH)
holds true by pseudo-free groups.
Order problem
The order problem states the following: Given an input x ? G to ﬁnd an integer n
which satisﬁes
e
x =1
where e is a positive integer and 1 is the identity of group. Thus it means that solving
e
x =1forpositiveinteger n.Theorderoftheelement x is the least positive value of
x in G.
Theorem 1 ([31]): In a pseudo-free group G, it is hard for an adversary to state
the order of an element p that is chosen randomly.
Power problem
The power problem states the following:
Given elements x and y such that x,y?G to ﬁnd an integern> 1
n
x =y
such that the value of n is the discrete logarithm of y to the base x in G.Thepower
problem is often considered to be hard for some groups G.ForexampleDi?eand
?
Hellmann determined that the power problem was hard in Z where e is a large prime.
e
Theorem 2([31]) In a pseudo-free groups, it is hard for an adversary given some
random values x and y to compute the discrete logarithm problem.
Root problem(RSA assumption)
The RSA problem states the following:
Given input y?G and an integer e greater than 1 to ﬁnd x that satisﬁes17
e
x =y
Theorem 3:([31])In a pseudo-free groups, the RSA assumption holds.
Proper power problem(strong RSA assumption)
The RSA problem states the following:
Given input y?G to ﬁnd an integer e greater than 1 and x that satisﬁes
e
x =y
Theorem 4:([31]) In pseudo-free groups, the strong RSA assumption holds.
In this case the adversary by himself selects an exponente> 1. The adversary cannot
solve the above equation even if he comes up with an integere>1onhisown.
Generalized Power problem
The generalized problem is deﬁned as:
Given inputs p,q?G to get integers x,y that satisﬁes

the intersection problem for cyclic subgroups.
3.6 Di?e Hellman assumption
Fascinatingly, the(computational) Di?e-Hellman problem is unsuitable for our formal-
ism. Di?e-Hellman assumption[31] is implied by pseudo-freeness is a very appealing
open problem. More speciﬁcally it is left as an open problem by Rivest whether Di?e
Hellman assumption holds the property of pseudo-freeness or not.
The computational Di?e-Hellman problem(CDH)[31] considers the following
Given some value g and two other values x and y such that18
i
x =g
j
y =g
for integers i and j that are chosen randomly to ﬁnd
ij
a =g
With the provided x and y,anadversarywillhaveslightchanceforcomputing a,
this is CDH assumption. The most obvious way to prove that the CDH assumption
is implied by pseudo-freeness is via above equations, wherei and j are integer-valued
variables, and a is a group valued variable. However, this argument does not succeed
as an adversary who violates CDH to deduce a need not be able to ﬁnd i and j (this
is DLP). It appears that any equation in variable a alone, for checking the correctness
of computed a is unavailable. In other words the decisional Di?e-Hellman problem is
not satisﬁable by checking a set of equations that involves a single element x.19
4 Static pseudo-free groups
Thenotionofpseudo-freegroupstostaticadversaryhasbeenextendedbyD.Micciancio[26].
Informally static pseudo-free groups are the computational groups where the adversary
is given only randomly chosen generators of the equation and his goal is to come up
with both equation and solution. More specially, in these groups the adversary is static
i.e. allowed to see only description of the group without any other information. If
the order of the group is known then it is very easy to compute solution for nontrivial
equation Thus in static pseudo-free group, order of the group is hidden from adversary.
The deﬁnition given by Micciancio was similar to that one deﬁned by Rivest in [31].
Micciancio proved that RSA groups holds much stronger version of pseudo-freeness. He
has shown that it is infeasible for an adversary to compute unsolvable equations along
with their solutions in a given computational group. His proof that RSA is pseudo-free
in[26]isbasedonfollowingpropertieswiththeassumptionthatstartingfromarbitrary
equations yields simpler and simpler equations.
• In a free group unsolvable equations are mapped to unsolvable equations.
• Over the computational group, one can map solution of original equations to
solution of resulting equations
4.1 Formal Deﬁnition
Deﬁnition 6 [26]- A family of computational groups G = G for N≥ 0 is said to be
N
static pseudo-free if all operations in G is performed in polynomial time in k. and
N
for every probabilistic polynomial time adversary A following holds. Let N? N be a
k
randomly chosen group index and deﬁne ?:A? G by choosing ?(a) at random in
N
G for each a? A. Then the probability on giving (N,?) as input, the adversary outputs
N
an equation ’E’ and solution ’S’ is almost negligible in k.
The deﬁnition of pseudo-free groups given by Rivest was for the single equation which
has no solution in a free group but has solution in computational group. Micciancio
made extension to the deﬁnition of pseudo-free groups that they consist of single equa-
tion to a system of equations by transforming system of equations to a single equation
which is equivalent to the system. Any system of equation in this transformation can
map to single equation whose solution set is a superset of the solutions to the system.
Deﬁnition 7 [26]- A family of computational groups G = G for N ≥ 0 is said
N

4.2 The RSA is static pseudo-free
Lemma 1[26]:- For a family of computational groupsG there exists an PPT algorithm
that on input an equation ? (which is a pair of {X,A} such that ’X’ is set of variables
an ’A’ is set of constants), a group G and an assignment ?:X ?G, outputs a single
? ?
variable equation ?and solution ? ? G that satisﬁes the following properties:
?
(1) If an equation ? does not have a solution in a free group, then ? also has no
solution in a free group.

5 Adaptive pseudo-free groups
In adaptive pseudo-free groups[9] an adversary is permitted to look at some nontrivial
equations and solutions along with the group description and ﬁnally his goal is to come
upwithnewnon-trivialequationandsolution. Asdiscussedabovethatincaseofstatic
pseudo-free groups the adversary is given only the randomly chosen generators used in
equation and he has to come up with new nontrivial equation and solution. Therefore
in our adaptive setting the adversary knows additional information which may help
him in solving other equations which do not have a solution in a free group. In case
of adaptive pseudo-free groups the game between challenger and adversary works as
follows[9]:
Set up:- In this case the challanger randomly selects an instance of compuational
group,sets an assignment and then gives assignments and group description to adver-
sary.
Equation queries:- In this phase the adversary can see some equations and solu-
tions
Challenge:- In this stage the adversary is given a chllenge that he has to produce
anewnon-trivialequationwithitssolution.
The deﬁnition of pseudo-free groups in adaptive setting[9] consists of two design deci-
sions. The ﬁrst issue with the design is to set equations for which an adversary can
see solutions and the second issue is to deﬁne what do we actually mean by non-trivial
multivariate equations in adaptive setting of pseudo-free groups.
As discussed above the ﬁrst issue is to ﬁx the type of equations but the important
thing which is to be considered here is how the equations can be produced for which
adversary can see solution because if we give too much freedom to adversary then it
can violate the security. Even keeping more restrictions here won’t allow us to deﬁne
adaptivesettingforanadversary. Thereforeﬁrstissuewiththedesignhasbeenresolved
by considering some parametric distribution over the set of equations.
5.1 Equation setup in adaptive pseudo-free groups
Insecondstageofadaptivepseudo-freegroups,theadversaryisallowedtoseesomenon-
trivial equations and solutions. Therefore the equations are controlled by parametric
distribution[9]. More speciﬁcally, equations are selected according to some parametric
distribution where the distribution depends on the parameter of an adversary. The
parameter supplied by adversary may lead to di?erent variety of adversaries ranging
from weak one to a strong one.
In case of weak adversary, we consider weak deﬁnition of adaptive pseudo-free groups23
where the adversary has no control over the equations. This means that the challenger
chooses an equation , sets an assignment, computes the solution of an equation and ﬁ-
nallygivesequationanditssolutiontoanadversary. Henceinthiscasetheadversaryis
notthatmuchadaptive,sohecangetallequationstogetherwiththeirsolutionsatonce.
In strongest form of adversary, the case is not the same as we saw in weakest form. In
this case the adversary is really adaptive and can select equations by his own choice.
The adversary can choose equations in an adaptive manner such that the adversary
ﬁrst choose an equation, get back its solutions, then choose another equation, get back
solution and so on. This deﬁnition of pseudo-freeness is known as strong adaptive
pseudo-freeness.
In static pseudo-free groups where the adversary is given only randomly chosen gen-
erators of the equation and his goal is to come up with solution to that equation. In
contrast, thenotionofpseudo-freenessinadaptivesetting[9]hasbeenextendedtomore
general level. In case of adaptive adversary,we have done a new kind of setting where
the adversary has limited control over the set of equations. This limitation is controlled
by parametric distribution ?.Theadversarysuppliedaparameter M of some length
which is required for sampling from distribution. The distribution then provides m+1
integers which is written as (e,s)whereas e and s are integers. Once the parameter
M is ﬁxed, then ?(M) is the distribution from which e and s are drawn.
5.2 Non-trivial Multivariate Equations
Rivest in [31] deﬁned non trivial equations in a way that they do not have any solution
in a free group. We deﬁne non-trivial equations in some other way because in our case
theadversaryisallowedtoseesomeadditionalinformationalsowhichmaybeusefulfor
himtosolveothernon-trivialequations. Thereforewedeﬁnenon-trivialitybyanalysing
equations over quotients of free groups.
we describe a framework that deﬁnes the non-triviality for multivariate equations.
Let [9] FA(a ...a )denotesafreeabeliangroupsuchthat {a ...a } are the gener-
1 m 1 m
ators of the group and there exists some binary relation??FA?FA on free abelian
group that makes equalities in words. As mentioned earlier, we would now hence aim
to characterize the set of all equalities that can be derived from? . Recollect the fact
that ultimately these equalities are construed over computational groups, thus there
are two ways for an adversary to formulate new equalities?. The ﬁrst way is by using
group operations and their properties over computational groups.
2 2 2 3 2
For example let ? = a a =a a then one can also ﬁnd a a =a a a =a a .Thus we
1 2 4 1 4 2
1 2 1 1 4
have computed ﬁrst equality just by multiplying a to both sides in the equation and
2
second we have derived from the property of computational group. For instance if one
b
can derive the equality in the form w = w b in computational group, then can also
2
1
? ?
ﬁnd equality of the form w = w provided b should be prime. Moreover,we have to
1 224
take into account the above possibility for any q as we search for an abstraction which
is not dependent on the order of the group.
Deﬁnition 8[9]- Let FA{a .....a } be a free abelian group deﬁned by some binary

5.3 Applications of adaptive pseudo-free groups
Adaptive pseudo-free groups[9] has an application to signatures and network coding
signatures. These applications has been deﬁned for univariate equations.
5.3.1 Signatures from Adaptive pseudo-free Groups
Construction of signature scheme
A signature scheme for family of adaptive pseudo-free groups with univariate equa-
tions[9] works as follows:
?
Let ? denotes a parametric distribution that belongs to a speciﬁc class of parametric
?
distribution ? and G be a family of adaptive pseudo-free groups with respect to ? .
n
Thus the signature scheme works as :
k
(1) Key Generation (1 ,N)
Let A = {a ,a ....a } and X = {x} be a set of constants and variables. In this
1 2 m
phase ﬁrst of all the key generation algorithm randomly choose an instance of compu-
tational group G from a family of computational groups G then sets an assignment
N
? :A?G .
N
?
Finally it sets veriﬁcaion key(public key)vk ={X,A,?,G ,? } and signing key(secret
N
key) as sk =order{G }.
N25
(2) Signing (sk,M)
?
In this phase, ? gives (e,s,r)asoutputandthesigningalgorithmusesecretkey
which is equal to order of G to compute solution of the univariate equation which is
N
in the form of
s
e 1 s
m
x =a .....a
1 m
If ? be a solution of the equation then the signing algorithm ﬁnally gives signature as
?=(e,s,r,?)for M.
(3) veriﬁcation(vk,M,?)
In this phase the veriﬁcation algorithm performs the veriﬁcation of signature on mes-
sage M by checking two conditions.
?
1)It veriﬁes whether ver (e,s,r,M)=1.
?
s
e 1 s
m
2)It checks if ? is a solution of the equation x =a .....a .
1 m
If both the conditions are satisﬁed than it gives 1 as output ,otherwise 0.
5.3.2 Linear Network Coding
Network coding is technique of transmitting information in which the nodes of the net-
work combines several packets they receive and then transmits them in order to achieve
maximuminformationﬂowinthenetwork. Thetransmittedinformation[9]isexpressed
in a vector form as (v ,...,v ). Before transmitting any information, a sequence of m-
1 m
augmented vectors(p ,...,p )aregeneratedbythesourcecodebyprepending u to v .
1 m i i
Each u has 1 in i-th position and 0 in other positions. The source in the network
i
sends the augmented vectors as packets in the network. The nodes in the network after
receivingp ,p ,....,p processthesepacketsbyperforminglinearcombinationandthen
1 2 m
sends them as a resultant vector to its outgoing edges.
Anodemustreceive m valid vectors pi of the form p1,p2,...,pm to get original in-
formation and for which us are linearly dependent. Thus the original message M is
i
retrieved as
?1
M =U V
Where U and V are the matrix with rows u ,u ,....,u and v ,v ,....,v .
1 2 m 1 2 m
The malicious nodes in the network makes the retrieval of the original information
impossible by injecting invalid vectors. The above mentioned idea is susceptible to
these kind of attacks. A solution to overcome this problem is to use network coding
signatures that checks whether a given vector is valid or not just by checking condition
whether it has been generated by linear combination of valid vectors.26
5.3.3 Network Coding Signatures
Deﬁnition 9[9] : A network coding signature is deﬁned by a triple of algorithms
(NetKG, Sign, Ver) such that:
k
(1) NetKG(1 ,N)
In this phase the algorithm takes input as k and N and produces output vk and sk.
Where k is the security parameter
N is the parameter that deﬁnes the size of signed vectors
vk is the public veriﬁcation key
sk is the secret signing key.
(2) sign(sk,V)
The signing algorithm in this phase produces signature ? for message M on input
sk, fid and m dimensional subspace V ?FN.
Where fid is a random ﬁle identiﬁer.
(3) ver(vk,V,?)
The veriﬁcation algorithm on input (vk,fid,V ? FN,)givesoutputas1(accept)
or 0 (reject). This algorithm checks one condition that if ? is valid signature produced
by signing algorithm for all honestly generated key pairs (vk,sk), all fid (random ﬁle
identiﬁer) and for all V ? FN.Iftheconditionissatisﬁedthenthealgorithmgives
output as 1 for all v?V otherwise 0.
5.3.4 Homomorphic Network Coding Signatures
Deﬁnition 10[9]:- : Homomorphic network coding signatures are special type of net-
work coding signatures that are deﬁned by a 4-tuple of algorithms ( NetKG, Sign, Ver,
Combine)such that:
(1) NetKG(1k, N)
In this phase the algorithm takes input as k and N and produces output vk and sk.
Where k is the security parameter
N is the parameter that deﬁnes the size of signed vectors
vk is the public veriﬁcation key
sk is the secret signing key.27
(2) Sign (sk, V, ﬁd)
The signing algorithm in this phase produces signature ? for message M on input
sk, fid and m dimensional subspace V ?FN.
Where fid is a random ﬁle identiﬁer.

valid signature for v which is obtained from linear combination wv .

(i=1)
(4) Ver (vk, V, ﬁd) -
The veriﬁcation algorithm on input (vk,fid,V ? FN,?), gives output as 1 means
accept or 0 means reject. This algorithm checks one condition that if sigma is valid
signature produced by signing algorithm for all honestly generated key pairs (vk,sk),
?
all fids (random ﬁle identiﬁer) and for all V ? FN . If the condition is satisﬁed the
algorithm gives ouput as 1 for all v?V otherwise 0.

Adaptive Pseudo-free Groups
Informally, adaptive-pseudo-free groups[9] are the computational groups in which the
adversary is permittef to look at several equations along with their solutions and his
goal is to solve a new non-trivial equation where non-trivial equations means the equa-
tions that do not have solutions in a free group.
The formal deﬁnition of adaptive pseudo-free groups[9] given below is for a set ’A’ of
?generators, acomputationalgroup{G } andadistribution?oversetofequations.

N N
parametric distribution ? is given to the Adversary A.
Equation queries
In this phase the adversary is permitted to look at the equations along with their
solutions. The queried equations are controlled by the adversary through paramet-
ric distribution ?.Thustheadversary A selects M for each query and gives it to
k
k k
challenger. Then the challenger runs (e ,s )? ?ˆ(M ), computes the solution ? for
k i

i i
i j
Challenge
After the adversary is acquaimted with equations and their solutions then he tries to
? ?
produce an equation ? with a solution ? .The adversary succeeds in the game if he
successfully produces a non trivial equation.
Deﬁnition11[9]Adaptivepseudo-freeGroups:- AfamilyofcomputationalGroup
G is said to be adaptive Pesudo-free with respect to some distribution ?, if for any set
’A’ of polynomial size, any probabilistic time adversary A succeeds in the game above
with at most negligible probability.
5.5 The RSA group is Adaptive Pseudo-free
?
Theorem 7 :- If the strong RSA assumption holds, then Z is adaptive pseudo-free
N
with respect to ?ˆ
Proof:- For the sake of contraction, we assume that RSA is not adaptive Pseudo-free33
with respect to multivariate equations. As per our deﬁnition of Adaptive pseudo-free
groups with respect to multivariate equations there exists a probabilistic polynomial
time adversary A with non-negligible probability that is supposed to produce an equa-
? ? ?
tion ? together with a solution ? in such a way that ? is non-trivial with respect to
previous queried equations.
?
For proof we construct an adversaryB from an adversaryA such thatBs main goal is
to break strong RSA assumption. More speciﬁcally, adversary B is constructed in such
a manner that if adversary A can break the adaptive pseuco-freeness of RSA group
with respect to multivariate equations, then B can break strong RSA assumption
k k k
Let ?ˆ(M )? (e ,s ,r )forall k ? (1...t),i? (1...n),j? (1...m).
k
i j i
where ’k’ is the number of queries done by adversary A.
?
In order to prove the theorem we show two types of adverseries if we consider e from
i
k
the equation( the adversary is supposed to produce) ande (already queried equations)
i
for all k ? (1...t),i? (1...n).

TYPE 2-
? ?
n t
? ? k
Adversary produce e such that e divides e .
i i i
i=1 k=1
Type 1 -
In this case we construct Adversary B that can break strong RSA assumption. As per
Strong RSA assumption, it is not possible for an adversary given y and N to ﬁnd x
and e such that
e
x =ymodN
? ?
where N is the product of two safe primes p and q and ’y’ has been taken from QR .
N
Thus Adversary B has input y and N and his aim is to compute e-th root x of y for
some e of his own choice.
The following scenario consist of three stages as follows.
(1) Setup -
1 t 1 t
In this phase Adversary B randomly selects {r ,.......,r } and computes {e ,.......,e }

as follows
k k
e =H(r )forall(i=1,......n)and(k=1,......,t).

Then B randomly selects {z ,z ,z ,.......,z } from {1,.....,N } in order to set assign-
1 2 3 m34

Let E = e .

Thus B sets assignments as follows.

Thus ?(a)=?(a ) .forall(j =2,.....,.m).

B also randomly selects {z ,z ,z ,.......,z } from {1,.....,N } and sets the constant
1 2 3 n

Ez

x =y

Z

Thus x =(x ) for i=3to n.

Finally Adversary B send assignments ? and description of the computational group
to adversary A.

Let Z =bpq +c.isselectedrandmolyfrom {1,2,....,N } and distribution of each

(2) Equation Queries -

InthisphaseadversaryAadaptivelyqueryequationsbysupplyingparameters{M ,....,M }

solve each equation B selects exponents according to parametric distribution ?ˆ(M)(

Therefore B solve equations as

(3) Challange -
Once the adversary A has seen equations along with their solutions in the previous

phase, then in this stage he tries to produce an equation ? along with its solution ?
?
such that ? is non-trivial to previously queried equations.

LetE= E(Z + s Z ? e Z)and u=GCD(e , E). Provided e does not

i
?
for e of his own choice and thus give (e /u,x)tobreakstrongRSAassumption.

Finally we need to show that (e)doesnotdivideEwithnon-negligibleprobabil-

ity. If we consider some prime r that divides (e ). As we are in Type 1 adversary
i
such that r does not divide E. Therefore we have to show that r does not divide
? ?
m n
? ? ? ?
Z + s Z ? e Z . As we know that Z =bpq +c .Since b is not known

In this case adversary outputs e such that e divides e.Thuswehave

two sub-cases as follows:

1) In this case for all k =1to t and i =1to n ,(r ?= r ). Therefore our assumption

we describe how to construct an adversary B whose main goal is to break strong RSA
assumption.36
Before proceeding towards simulation we provide some details that will be usefull for

then perform the simulation as follows:

Finally Adversary B sends assignments ? and description of the computational Group

?
Corollary1[9] :-If the strong RSA assumption holds, then Z is adaptive pseudo-free
N
with multivariate equations with respect to ?ˆ .
S
The proof for the given corollary follows from that of theorem 1. The main idea here is
that one can guess s in advance with non-negligible probability when they are small.
i
As we have deﬁned above that ?ˆ is a variant of ?ˆ such that s is equal to 0 and
S 2
s?(i=3tom)? Z is the output of chameleon hash function CH(M,R)deﬁnedover
i e
parameter M and randomness R.
Corollary 2[9] :- If the strong RSA assumption holds and CH is a chameleon hash
?
function, then Z is adaptive pseudo-free with multivariate equations with respect to
N
?ˆ .
CH
The corollary has same proof as deﬁned in corollary 1. The main idea here is that
one can use the property of chameleon hash functions during simulation in order to
choose s in advance.

Weak Adaptive Pseudo-freeness of the RSA Group:-
In weakest form of adaptive pseudo-free groups, the adversary at the start is allowed
1 t
to select parameters M ,...,M before giving any group description.If one can think of
such a notion of adaptive pseudo-freeness then we can prove theorem 1 in more general
way with respect to much general distribution than ?ˆ where (e,s ,...,s )needstobe

new set of equations. In deﬁnition [11] the adversary is allowed to see some non-trivial
equations along with solutions and ﬁnally he has to come up with a new non-trivial
equation and solution. Therefore in this case the game is same as the adversary is

6.2 Adaptive Pseudo-free Groups With System of Equations
The formal deﬁnition of adaptive pseudo-free groups[9] given below is for a set ’A’ of
?generators, acomputationalgroup{G } andadistribution?oversetofequations.
N N
Setup
In this phase ﬁrst of all the challenger randomly selects instance of computational
group {G } that belongs to a family of G where G = {G } and then sets an

assignment n: A?{G } for set A of generators and parametric distribution ?.At

Equation queries
In this phase the adversary is permitted to look at equations together with their solu-
tions. The queried equations are controlled by the adversary through parametric distri-
bution ?.Thustheadversary A chooses M for each query and gives it to challenger.

Deﬁnition13[9]AdaptivePseudo-freeGroupswithSystemofEquations:- A
family of computational GroupG is said to be adaptive Pseudo-free with respect to some
distribution ?, if for any set ’A’ of polynomial size, any probabilistic time adversary A
succeeds in the game above with at most negligible probability.43
7 Conclusion
In this project we have seen that the concept of pseudo-freeness seems to be a strong,
natural and quite plausible in commonly used groups in cryptography. We have ex-
plored the notion of adaptive pseudo-free groups from univariate to multivariate and
system of equations. We have studied and identiﬁed pseudo-free group with respect to
adaptive adversaries who aim to solve non trivial equations along with their solutions.
Firstofallwehaveshowntrivialityforthecaseofadaptivepseudo-freegroupsandthen
introduced formal deﬁnition of such groups for multivariate and system of equations.
There are many open problems left by Rivest[31]. As one of the open problem is
to ﬁnd groups in cryptography that satisﬁes the notion of pseudo-free groups. Thus
?
for a case we have proved the adaptive pseudo-freeness of the RSA group (Z )with
N
multivarite equations under reasonable conditions such that N is the product of two
safe primes. Another problem in [31]is to prove the pseudo-freeness of Di?e-Hellman
assumption as we have seen that the Di?e-Hellman assumption(either computational
or decisional) does not satisﬁes the property of pseudo-free groups. In this project we
have not addressed this problem but in future it would be interesting to see whether
Di?e-Hellman assumption holds our deﬁnition of adaptive pseudo-free groups.
Another open research in this direction is to to ﬁnd crytographic applications[26] that
provides the usefullness of such groups in cryptography. In next section we have just
provide an idea of extracting an application out of adaptive pseudo-free groups with
respecttomultivariteequations. Itwouldbeinterestingtoseewhetherthatapplication
really holds our deﬁnition and can capture use of pseudo-free groups in cryptography.44
8 Future Work
The study of pseudo-free groups carried out so far did not allow us to extract appli-
cations out of them because of prime generation. As an ﬁrst application of adaptive
pseudo-free groups (a signature scheme) for univariate equations deﬁned in [9], is more
e?cient than the current RSA based signature schemes but it requires a longer public
key. It may be a case that we can resolve this issue by constructing a signature scheme
out of adaptive pseudo-free groups with multivariate equations. One way to construct
amoree?cientsignatureschemeistoconsiderequationsthatdonothaveprimeex-
ponents as prime generation is the bottleneck.
The cryptographic assumptions such as discrete logarithm problem and the Di?e-
Hellman problem[26] are considered at least as hard as factoring and currently there
is no relation between pseudo-free groups and these assumptions. An interesting work
is to see that whether such cryptographic assumptions in pseudo-free groups are com-
putationally hard. Finally it would be interesting to ﬁnd relationship between pseudo-
freeness and other cryptographic assumptions with the intuition of using such groups
in cryptography.45

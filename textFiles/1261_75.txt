Abstract
The objective of this project is to develop a novel phase-locked loop (PLL) sys-
tem in cooperation with Xintronix Ltd, who set up the speciﬁcation. The task
is divided into two projects, focusing on the implementation of di?erent parts.
The PLL in this part comprises a testbench written in VerilogA, an LC oscilla-
tor with a cross-coupled NMOS-PMOS architecture and a quadrature frequency
converter consisting of two Gilbert Cell type mixers, sharing their load for up-
/down-conversion. The PLL is made of several blocks: a phase-detector, a signal
processor with a digital 32-bit output, a ??-digital-to-analogue-modulator with
a low-pass ﬁlter and a quadrature frequency converter fed by an LC oscillator and
the ??-modulator’s output. The frequency of the LC oscillator was speciﬁed to
be 5 GHz. A divider, part of the VerilogA testbench, divides that frequency down
by two using two D-Flip-Flops. Thereby, two streams with a quadrature relation
and 2.5 GHz are created. The quadrature frequency converter is fed by these two
streams and quadrature related streams from the ??-modulator with a frequency
in the range of 1 mHz up to 250 kHz. The purpose of the quadrature frequency
converter is to compensate for deviations in the LC oscillator and divider from
the ideal 2.5 GHz. The output of the PLL is supposed to be exactly 2.5 GHz.
Characteristics of the oscillator and the mixer were measured by means of sim-
ulations. A phase noise of 133.3 dBc/Hz at an o?set of 1 MHz from the oscillation
centre frequency was achieved for the LC oscillator. The mixer has a noise ﬁg-
ure of 36 dB at a 1 MHz o?set. The conversion gain is 7.6 dB and the IIP3,
characterising the linearity, is at -8 dBm.
The achievements made in this project are:
• An ideal testbench was developed in VerilogA for all the blocks of the PLL,
which was shown working (Chapter 4.2).
• AnLCoscillatorwasdevelopedontransistorlevelbasedonthecross-coupled
NMOS-PMOS architecture. Three approaches were made to achieve best
results (Chapter 4.3).
• The oscillator has competitive low phase noise and a good stability over
PVT variations (Chapter 5.1).
• Two Gilbert Cells were designed sharing one pair of resistive loads to form
a quadrature frequency converter (Chapter 4.4).
• The mixer has reasonable characteristics compared to publications (Chap-
ter 5.2).

part of this project and will be described in detail in this paper
The PLL developed in this project is illustrated in Figure 1.1. It comprises a
digitally controlled frequency modulator and a testbench environment, which is
shown in grey in Figure 1.1. The testbench is written in the hardware description
language VerilogA and serves as a simulation of the PLL as a whole system. It
includesaphasedetectoraswellasasignalprocessor, whichperformsananalogue-
to-digital conversion and feeds a digital output into the frequency modulator.
Additionally the testbench contains a divider for the feedback frequency.
The frequency modulator forms the main part of this work. It consists of a
Sigma-Delta-Modulator, which translates the digital input signal via pulse density
modulation into an analogue signal and is implemented in VerilogA. To reduce
the noise which might have been induced by the input frequency itself, a ﬁlter is
applied to the output of the Sigma-Delta-Modulator to push the noise out of the
spectrum. That part will be implemented in the complementary project and is
coloured blue in Figure 1.1.
The components described in the following paragraphs, which are also included
in the frequency synthesiser, will be developed as part of this project.
The ﬁltered signal is used as an input for a quadrature frequency converter. The
signal consists of two channels with the same frequency but in quadrature. The
11 Introduction
frequency converter contains two mixers for which Gilbert Cells will be used. A
Gilbert Cell can work as an analogue multiplier. It is driven by a local oscillator
and modulates an input frequency to either the sum of the oscillator and input
frequency or the di?erence of both. The mixers are driven by signals with a
frequency of 2.5 GHz, which are generated by an oscillator, the design of which is
also part of this project. The oscillator frequency is originally 5 GHz and is then
divided by two using two D-ﬂip-ﬂops. The results are two output streams with
?
exactly the same frequencies, but by 90 shifted phases, which therefore makes
these streams operate in quadrature. These streams are fed into one mixer each,
where they are mixed with the input I/Q and generate the PLL output frequency
to be fed back and phase-locked. In high frequency design, parasitic capacitances
play a major role and therefore need special attention. By being charged and
discharged alternately, they could cause a circuit to oscillate and thus make it
unstable. This is of special importance for the design of the Gilbert Cells. The
LC oscillator forms an important part of the system, because it sets the limit
for the output frequency. Additionally it is noise critical, which has to be taken
into account during designing, as any noise in the LC oscillator is multiplied by
the Gilbert Cell and adds to the noise on the output. The oscillator also needs
to be very accurate and stable over variations in process, supply voltage and
temperature (PVT) for the same reasons.
This PLL will be used to clean a clock signal on the input which is impaired by
jitter. The output should have very low jitter and therefore the implementation
will focus on inducing as little noise as possible. Besides the LC oscillator, the
input signal coming into the PLL is a noise critical part. It is ﬁrstly ﬁltered by
a low-pass ﬁlter in the signal processor, to remove the broadband noise on the
input and then ﬁltered again by the Sigma-Delta-Modulator. The noise of the
LC oscillator has to be compensated by the feedback loop. An important part of
the project is to ﬁnally determine the actual present noise by means of simulative
measurements and if applicable reducing it.
This research review will explain the backgrounds necessary to understand the
project’s intent and introduce the state of the art of current frequency synthesis-
ers and their components. Chapter 2 explains basics on LC oscillators, Gilbert
Cells and quadrature frequency converters, as well as fundamentals of PLLs. Re-
cent publications on those components are evaluated and discussed in Chapter 3.
Furthermore, the chosen architectures for the designs are introduced. The imple-
mentation is shown in Chapter 4. There, several approaches for the designs are
compared. The component geometries are derived from mathematical equations.
Chapter 5 shows the simulations of the designs and characteristic ﬁgures describ-
ing their quality. This review concludes with a summary of the ﬁndings and an
outlook for future improvement in Chapter 6.
22 Background
This chapter summarises the most important background information and thereby
points out the di?culties of this project. Basics of LC oscillators are explained
and two fundamental architectures presented. Important terms in the context of
oscillators such as phase noise and the quality factor are clariﬁed. Furthermore,
mixer behaviour and characteristics are outlined and the circuit of a so called
Gilbert Cell is demonstrated in detail. Finally, several approaches for phase-
locked loops are illustrated and brieﬂy discussed. After reading this chapter the
reader should be able to understand and judge the analysis of the above mentioned
components, which will be conducted in the next chapter.
2.1 LC Oscillators
Oscillators provide a periodic output signal with a certain dominant frequency
and, generally, harmonically related energy. Several approaches exist, some of
which will be described in the following section together with their advantages
and disadvantages. The focus is on LC oscillators, which comprise an inductor
and a capacitor as their frequency selective components and active feedback to
induce oscillation.
The primary metric under control of the designer in an oscillator is the resonant
frequency. The metric that can only partially be controlled is phase noise, which
is a critical term for oscillators, especially if they are used as a high frequency
reference in a more complex system. In that case any inaccuracy is forwarded to
the system, which the oscillator is embedded in. Phase noise can inﬂuence the
timing of data encoding in communication lines and produce errors in transmit-
ted data via jitter. When the oscillator is used for a clocked system, it can cause
synchronisation issues. Therefore, techniques for avoiding high phase noise will
be introduced and discussed.
The most common types in CMOS high frequency technology are digital ring
oscillators and LC oscillators. Both are used for di?erent applications because
their advantages and disadvantages satisfy di?erent requirements.
Ring oscillators are easy to implement. They mainly consist of an odd number
of cascaded inverters, where the output is connected to the input. That setup
forces the system to oscillate. For a ring oscillator no large passive elements such
as inductors are necessary, which means they consume only a small area on a chip.
When a ring oscillator acts as a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) and thus is
32 Background
controllable by a voltage input, the frequency that it can output is variable over
a wide range. However, in comparison to LC oscillators ring oscillators consume
more power and their noise is typically much higher. [1]
The requirements for the oscillator that will be used as a reference in the PLL of
this project are high accuracy, which means low jitter and phase noise, as well as
low power consumption. The area consumed on the chip should be as little as pos-
sible, but there is no strict limit, which means that use of an inductor is generally
possible. Thus, a LC oscillator is the better choice for this implementation.

In reality the devices are not ideal. They have a parasitic resistance, as shown in
Figure 2.1. The ﬁrst circuit shows the devices with parasitic resistance R or R
C L
respectively in series to their corresponding device and the second circuit shows
an equivalent, whereR incorporates both parasitic resistances. Such a resonator
P
circuit is referred to as LC tank. [2]
The problem of the parasitic resistances is, that they attenuate the amplitude
of the oscillatory response to an energy input and eventually force it to stop.
Figure 2.2 shows a setup for a compensating circuit, where an active device is
added which has a resistance of?R . Ideally, the parasitic resistance and the
P
compensating negative resistance cancel each other completely out. That ensures
a steady oscillation with no losses. [1]
An oscillator can be described as a positive feedback system with an ampliﬁer,
where the ampliﬁed signal is fed back. The block diagram of such a system is
illustrated in Figure 2.3. The gain of the ampliﬁer is A(j?) and the feedback is
?(j?), both are dependent on the frequency. The product of both is called loop
gain. That feedback system can be summarised by

Looking at the transfer function of the system in 2.2, one can see that two
conditions need to be met to achieve a steady oscillation. If the loop gain is equal
to one, the transfer function becomes inﬁnity. The system is unstable and starts
oscillating. The phase of the loop gain has to be zero at this point. This is called
Barkhausen criterion. [3]

Figure 2.3: Feedback System
There are two commonly used types of feedback LC oscillators, the Colpitts
and the Hartley, shown in Figure 2.4a and 2.4b. In both cases the parallel LC
circuit is connected between the gate and drain of a MOSFET. In case of the
Colpitts oscillator, a capacitive divider is used to feed some of the voltage back to
the source of the MOSFET. In case of a Hartley oscillator, an inductive divider
is used. The resistor R compensates inductive losses and represents the output
resistance of the MOSFET as well as the load of the oscillator. [3]
To minimise the unwanted induced noise, mostly only one transistor is used in
the active circuit of a LC oscillator, because transistors are the main sources of
noise in a circuit. As the oscillator of this project should provide a high frequency,
parasitics play a major role and have to be taken into account for calculating the
oscillation frequency. The parasitic capacitors are charged and discharged during
oscillation, which might delay or even distort the signal. [2]
Colpitts oscillators are preferred over Hartley oscillators for ﬁxed-voltage oscil-
lators, because they only require one inductor. That also has the advantage of

better results in terms of phase noise because the two inductors of the Hartley con-
ﬁguration bear a risk of mutual inductance and therefore noise introduction. [2, 4]
Oscillators are prone to variations in the surrounding temperature of the cir-
cuit, the process variations during manufacturing and the supply voltage. This is
known as PVT (process, voltage, temperature) variations. For the process varia-
tions, there are statistical models available, called corner cases, which were taken
from manufactured circuits and can be used for simulations. In the technology
used in this project, there are only corner cases available for transistors. This
corner cases vary the switching speed of NMOS and PMOS transistors. Four set-
tings are available, SS, which means both NMOS and PMOS are slow, SF, which
means NMOS transistors are slow and PMOS types fast, FS, where NMOS are
fast and PMOS slow, and ﬁnally FF where both types are switching fast. The
voltage variation is usually taken into account from± 10% of the desired supply
voltage. The temperature range depends on the desired application of the circuit.
For commercial products, the range is usually from 0°C to 70°C, for automotive
and military applicationas it is about -55°C to 125 °C.
PVTvariationsshouldbetakenintoaccounttosimulatethecircuitsrealistically
and make the speciﬁcation valid in a realistic environment. Especially oscillators
are very sensitive to these variations and the chosen architecture can strongly in-
ﬂuence the stability under certain circumstances. This fact is taken into account
for choosing the architecture of this project’s oscillator.
The deviation of the frequency due to noise is measured as phase noise. A periodic
sinusoidal signal oscillating at a frequency of ? can be described by
0
v(t) =V ·cos(? t). (2.3)
0 0
However, taking phase noise into account, the equation changes to
v(t) =V ·cos(? t +? (t)), (2.4)

where ? (t) represents the deviation from the actual frequency. Figure 2.5 shows

the spectrum of an ideal oscillator in (a) and the spectrum of a real oscillator with
noise in (b). The ideal oscillator has an impulse response, while the real oscillator
gives a spread spectrum. Phase noise is usually measured in dBc/Hz. Therefore
the noise power in a 1Hz wide band at an o?set of ?? from ? is calculated and
0
set in relation to the carrier power. That is where the ‘dBc’ comes from, it states
that the signal is measured in relation to the carrier signal. [2]

To minimise the phase noise of an oscillator, their Q must be high. Q is a
quality parameter of an LC circuit, that can be deﬁned in several ways. One of
energystoredinLC
them is to describe it as 2π· . The common way to describe

Generally, LC oscillators with a Q greater than 20 have a su?cient small phase
noise, but that also depends on the supply voltage. The phase noise increases
when lowering the supply voltage and therefore the power. [2]
Other types of noise are ﬂicker noise and white noise. Flicker noise is the
dominant low-frequency noise in MOSFETs. Although several studies exist, its
1
origin is not fully explored yet. It is also known as -noise, because its spectral
f
density is inversely proportional to frequency. [5]

2.2 Gilbert Cell Mixers
A mixer is a non-linear device, which performs a frequency conversion, either
up or down, of two input frequencies to one mixed output. They are a class of
multipliers because they can multiply their two inputs. One of these inputs is a
local oscillator (LO), which usually has a ﬁxed frequency. The other input and
output frequency names depend on the way the conversion is performed. For up-
conversion the second input is the intermediate frequency (IF) that can vary in a
given range. The mixed output signal is then called the radio frequency (RF). For
down-conversion the two names are the other way round, as then the second input
has a higher frequency than the output, which is also usually in the RF region. [7]
The following section will give an overview of mixer basics and their charac-
teristics and focus on the Gilbert cell architecture [8], which will be used in the
project to implement a quadrature frequency converter, the functionality of which
will be described as well in this section.

82.2 Gilbert Cell Mixers
The result term includes a di?erence frequency and a sum frequency. These terms
are responsible for either down-conversion or up-conversion. [7, 9]
Figure 2.6: Mixer output signal
An example of a typical mixer output plot is shown in Figure 2.6. The blue
trace shows the IF input signal and the green trace the LO input frequency. The
red trace shows the mixed output signal. It can be seen that the output frequency
is a mixture of both input frequencies.
As shown in Equation 2.9 it does not matter if the di?erence of the input fre-
quencies is positive or negative. Therefore for down-conversion, there always exist
two frequencies which can be applied to the input port and lead to the same fre-
quency on the output port, one smaller than the frequency of the local oscillator
and one larger. The unwanted frequency that leads to the same result is called
image frequency and can be ﬁltered by an image-reject-ﬁlter put in front of the
mixer. [2]
The quality of a mixer is determined by a number of characteristics, which are
conversion gain, noise ﬁgure, linearity and isolation.
Conversion gain needs to be separated into voltage conversion gain and power
conversion gain. It describes the ampliﬁcation of the input signal to the output
signal. Forthevoltageconversiongainitistheratiooftheamplitudesofinputand

by the IF amplitude V and results in . The power conversion gain is the
IF
2
power delivered to the load on the RF port divided by the IF source power. If
the mixer’s input and load impedance are equal to the source impedance, voltage
and power conversion gain are the same. [2, 7]
Noise Figure (NF) describes the ratio between the input signal to noise ratio
(SNR) and the output SNR. There is single-sideband (SSB) noise ﬁgure, which
describes the case, when the image frequency is ﬁltered out. The double-sideband
(DSB) noise ﬁgure describes the case where both, image frequency and RF are
desired. [7]
Figure 2.7 shows the non-linear behaviour of a mixer. The output power is
plotted over the input power on a logarithmic scale. For small input power the
mixerbehaveslinearly, butwithincreasingpower, atsomepointitstartsdeviating
from its linear extrapolation. The point where the di?erence between the linear
curve and the deviation is 1dB is called the 1dB compression point and marks the

power at which the mixer is deemed to have entered saturation. The thin trace
represents the third harmonic distortion of the non-linear mixer. Its crossing
point with the linearly extrapolated ﬁrst order harmonic is called the third order
intercept point. It is often used for comparison of di?erent mixers, because it is a
translatable metric. [7]
Isolation explains how much a signal port leaks to a neighbouring port, in other
words a linear energy transfer between any two of the mixer ports. [9]
The Gilbert Cell mixer is an active double-sideband, four-quadrant mixer. Its
circuit is shown in Figure 2.8. The LO frequency is applied to the v input and
in1
the IF signal is applied tov . The reason therefore is, that the higher frequency
in2
signal is more prone to parasitics. In this conﬁguration the high frequency signal
does not have to charge and discharge the gate capacitances of the cross coupled
transistor pairs. It is loaded by resistors, which have only a very small parasitic
capacitance.
The Gilbert Cell consists of two di?erential pairs and two resistive loads. The
IF input transistors act as a transconductor and translate the applied voltage into
a current. The transconductor can induce undesired noise into the system by
imperfect switching of the transistors. Also, when both transistors are conducting
at the same time, they produce noise. Additionally, because most mixers of this
type have a positive gain, noise generated by the local oscillator is ampliﬁed.
Therefore it is very important to have a very noise free oscillator as a reference on
the LO port. Another problem are the intrinsic capacitances of the transistors,
which are charged and discharged by the LC resonator. They also a?ect linearity
of a Gilbert Cell. For designing the mixer, it is important that the amplitudes of
the input signals are chosen below the 1dB compression point, to keep the mixer
in the quasi-linear region. Linearity can be improved by adding resistors to the
IF input. [7]
The Gilbert Cells will be used in the frequency synthesiser for a quadrature fre-

quency converter, which is illustrated in Figure 2.9. There, two mixers are fed
on their IF input by the same signal coming from the sine wave generator, only
that for one input the frequency is phase shifted by 90°. To generate these two
streams, the LO frequency is divided by two by means of a D-Flip-Flop divider,
illustrated in Figure 2.10. The two used D-Flip-Flops are edge sensitive to both,
rising and falling edge, to act as a by-2-divider. That can be extracted from the
truth-table in Table 2.1. Both streams have half the oscillator frequency and one
of the streams is phase shifted by 90°. Each mixer is then fed on their LO input
by one of the streams. The phase shifting by 90° is necessary to set the streams in
quadrature. Byusingtwomixersoperatingonthesamefrequenciesbutinquadra-
ture, the sum or di?erence of the two di?erent frequencies can easily be generated.
An adder or a subtractor can be used on the generated I and Q streams from the
mixers. Adding results in down-converting, subtracting in up-converting, due to
equation 2.10.

Figure2.11showstheresultgraphically. ThegreenlinerepresentstheLOinput,
the blue line represents the IF input and the red trace shows the up-converted RF
output. As can be seen, the output signal has a constant amplitude, in contrast
to the output of one mixer. This is due to the 90° phase shift, which sets the
signals in a relation such that the subsequent addition or subtraction of the two
mixer signals results in an amplitude which is the product of the two input signals’
amplitudes.
An easy way of implementing the adder or subtractor is by using load sharing,
wheretwomixersareconnectedtothesameload. ThisisillustratedinFigure2.12.
By just inverting the signals on the IF port, it can be inﬂuenced, if the load
sharing acts as up-converting or down-converting. This feature will be used in the
implementation to steer the LC oscillator frequency up or down and thus produce
a very accurate output.
To minimise the time where both sides of the Gilbert Cell are conducting, the
inputs need to be biased. This can be done by using pull up resistors to the
biasing voltage.
The LO inputs are high frequency inputs and therefore need coupling capacitors
to remove the DC signal which might be present. The IF frequency will be so close
to DC in this project, that coupling capacitors would not let the actual signal pass.
Therefore the IF inputs don’t have coupling capacitors.

2.3 Phase-Locked Loops
The purpose of a phase-locked loop (PLL) is to generate a stable, jitter-free fre-
quency from a reference via a feedback system.
This section will ﬁrst describe a classical PLL, which consists of a phase de-
tector, a low-pass ﬁlter, a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) and in some cases
a divider for the feedback path. Then three popular architecture of frequency
synthesisers will be discussed, which are integer-N synthesisers, fractional-N syn-
thesisers and dual-loop synthesisers.
A PLL generates a signal from an input frequency, which is locked to the input
frequency by means of feedback. Its phase is proportional to the ﬁltered voltage
output v of the phase detector. However, that does not necessarily mean, that
?
their frequencies are the same. By using a divider in the feedback path, the output
frequency can be a multiple of the input. A general overview of a PLL system
with a divider is illustrated in Figure 2.13.
Figure 2.14 shows how the feedback frequency is locked to the reference over
time. Itisnotalinearprocess, whichisduetothefeedback. Becauseofresolution,
the output frequency might slightly oscillate around the actual value, even when
locking has occurred.
The voltage controlled oscillator generates the output frequency. Its frequency
can be controlled via a voltage applied to the input. In most implementations,
increasing the voltage, increases the frequency generated by the VCO and low-
ering the voltage, decreases the frequency. The voltage is generated by a phase

Figure 2.14: Output locking to the reference over time
detector. The phase detector can simply be an XOR-gate, if the system oper-
ates on a square wave signal. It compares the phase of the input signal and the
fed back output signal, if applicable divided by a certain factor, and generates a
voltage accordingly which is output. The voltage is linearly proportional to the
di?erence of the input phases. A low-pass ﬁlter removes undesired high frequency
components in the signal. [2]
An integer-N synthesiser is shown in Figure 2.15. Other than the basic model
above, this synthesiser uses a charge pump to deliver charge to the ﬁlter. The
phase detector basically controls two switches, which either charge the ﬁlter ca-
pacitance up to a higher value or discharge it to a lower value. The amount of
charge that is delivered to or drawn from the capacitor is proportional to the fre-
quency di?erence of the input signal and the feedback signal. The notable feature
of this architecture is, that the divider in the feedback path is digitally control-
lable. However, with this implementation the frequency can only be divided by
integers. The division ratio has to be fairly large, to lock the VCO to the input,
which results in high power consumption of the divider and higher phase noise on
the output. [1]

Figure 2.15: Integer-N synthesiser architecture
In contrast, the fractional-N synthesiser overcomes those problems by being
able to divide by fractions. It uses an accumulator controlled dual modulus pro-
grammable divider, which is incremented each cycle. Every time the accumulator
overﬂows, the divider changes its division ratio. The ratio is still an integer, but
when calculating the average division, the result is a fraction. [1]
The fractional-N synthesiser can operate on larger reference frequencies than
the integer-N. Therefore the divisor can be smaller and there is less phase noise
present in the system. The accumulator consumes however a higher current,
because it operates on a higher frequency. To push the noise out of the loop
bandwidth to higher frequencies, a ??-Modulator can be used. The higher its
order, thehigherthenoisesuppressionbutthestabilityofthesystemdecreases.[1]

f is a ﬁxed high frequency source and generates the carrier which is modulated

together with the signal generated from the system input frequency f . By
ref2
varying the divisor M, the frequency which is modulated on the output of the
system, is varied as well. Because f is much higher than the channel spacing,
ref1
the phase noise of the upper PLL’s VCO is outside the loop bandwidth. The phase
noise of the lower PLL’s VCO is small anyway, because f is a low frequency

183 State of the Art
This chapter’s purpose is to demonstrate recent research conducted in the ﬁeld of
this project’s interest. Components such as LC oscillators, quadrature frequency
mixers and frequency synthesisers published in recent papers are reviewed and
their suitability for the design of the frequency synthesiser and its blocks of this
project is examined.
3.1 LC Oscillators
This section will introduce state-of-the-art LC oscillators. Common conﬁgura-
tions, such as the Colpitts and the Hartley oscillator, were already discussed in
chapter 2.1.
The Colpitts oscillator, illustrated in Figure 2.4a, has a fairly simple topology
and can be used in circuits, where harmonic distortion is not a critical issue. [10]

To provide su?cient gain, the condition for oscillation is G ≥ 4/R. [10]

Another approach are the cross-coupled conﬁgurations. There is a NMOS-only
version, which uses two transistors and a NMOS-PMOS version, which uses four
transistors.
The cross-coupled NMOS oscillator, which is illustrated in Figure 3.1a, needs
two inductors. They are usually on-chip and have a low Q. The active circuit is
a di?erential pair fed by a constant current source I . The resistors R and R
bias 1 2
represent the parasitics of the inductors L and L respectively. The capacitors
1 2
C andC contain the load as well as the parasitic capacitances of the chip. The
1 2
capacitors could also be replaced by a varactor, to facilitate frequency tuning.[10]
In case the devices of the circuit are symmetrically sized, the equivalent resis-
tance of the two transistors is given by G =?2/g , where g is the transcon-
m m m
ductance of one transistor. To build up the oscillation of the circuit, the parasitic
inductor resistance and the resistance of the transistor added together must be
negative, which means that g ≥ 1/R, where R =R =R . [10]
m 1 2
193 State of the Art
Comparison with the G of the Colpitts oscillator shows, that its transistor is
m
four times larger than the the two transistors of the cross-coupled conﬁguration
together. This is a critical issue, if the inductor has a low Q and therefore a
low R, because then the g of the transistor must be very large. Additionally, a
m
larger area increases the parasitics. In return, the cross-coupled oscillator needs
two inductors, which consume a large area. [10]
The NMOS-PMOS cross-coupled oscillator is shown in Figure 3.1b. There, two
di?erential pairs are used, one NMOS and one PMOS. It uses again only one in-
ductor. The advantage over the NMOS-only circuit is, that the output amplitude
is twice as high, while using the same currentI . The NMOS-PMOS circuit has
bias
also a higher negative resistance which means, that a lower bias current is needed
to compensate for the loss in the tank than for the NMOS-only circuit. [10]

The critical design part of the LC oscillator is the inductor. It consumes a
larger area on the chip the higher its inductance is. The goal is to keep its size
as small as possible, but the higher the inductance is, the better are the oscillator
characteristics. Because of its spiral shape, the inductor has many parasitics, that
have to be taken into account for the design. The inductance is a function of the
number of turns, the dimensions of the metal layer, the average side length of the
turns and the spacing between the windings of the inductor. An equivalent circuit
of a square spiral inductor, where parasitics are taken into account, is shown in
Figure 3.2. Capacitors and resistors model the losses of the inductor. An on-chip
inductor can be as high as around 10nH. This might not sound as a high value,
but implemented on chip, an inductor consumes a large area, because of its spiral

Capacitors are also critical, especially for high frequency applications, such as
the one in this project. Capacitances inﬂuence the Q of an oscillator, if their
resistance is too high. The mostly used capacitors consist of metal-oxide-metal
layers and have a fairly high resistance. Integrated-ﬁnger capacitors are therefore
preferred. [10]
A parasitic compensated circuit is proposed in [11]. The phase noise is improved
by 4dB in comparison to the non-compensated circuit. The schematic is shown
in Figure 3.3a. [11]
To reduce the power dissipation of an oscillator, [12] proposed a circuit with
a di?erential ampliﬁer, to increase the negative resistance of the active circuit.
That technique minimises the current, necessary to start the oscillation. However,
the current consumption of the ampliﬁer has to be taken into account and an
evaluation of the actual saved current is necessary to verify the proﬁtability. The
schematic is illustrated in Figure 3.3b. [12]
In [13], a modiﬁed cross-coupled circuit is proposed, where an NMOS transistor
isaddedoneachsidebetweentheinductorandtheNMOScross-coupledpair, with
their gates connected toV . These transistors provide the circuit with a su?cient
dd
high transconductance to start the oscillation. The power that is consumed by
the circuit is thereby minimised. [13]
A di?erential Hartley oscillator in 180nm CMOS technology is proposed in [14].
They use a transformer for self-biasing, two more inductors, a varactor and two
inverters for their topology. [14]
Table 3.1 shows a comparison of the above mentioned oscillator designs and
their characteristics.
The cross-coupled LC oscillator is known to be very stable over PVT variations
compared to other common analogue architectures. It also has the advantage that

it only needs one inductor, which signiﬁcantly saves area on the chip compared to
architectures using more inductors. For these reasons, this architecture is chosen
for the oscillator implemented in this project.
3.2 Gilbert Cell Mixers
In this section, several mixers will be compared by means of their performance
characteristics.
A 2GHz quadrature down-conversion mixer is introduced by [15]. Its schematic
is shown in Figure 3.4a. The circuit has a good LO-IF port isolation of -15.65dB

and low substrate noise. Q1 to Q6 of Figure 3.4a form the driver stage and am-
plify the input signal to reduce switching noise. The input di?erential pairs have
a linear transconductance over a small range of input voltages. Therefore the
overall transconductance is constant over a certain input range. A bias circuit,
illustrated in Figure 3.4b, is attached to the quadrature mixer, to compensate for
temperature and supply voltage variations and to make the ampliﬁcation of the
mixer stable. [15]

Gilbert Cells, introduced in recent papers, are mostly used as down-converters,
where the LO and RF input signals are in a similar order of magnitude. For this
project, the Gilbert Cell will be used for both up- and down-conversion to com-
pensate for inaccuracies in the reference on the input of the frequency synthesiser
and in the LC oscillator. That way, a very clean and noise free signal is generated
on the output. As the inaccuracies are expected to be not more then a couple of
hundreds of kHz, the IF input range is very small. It also means, that the RF
output frequency is very close to the LO frequency, which means it is very high.
233 State of the Art
3.3 Frequency Synthesisers
This section will give some brief examples of state-of-the-art frequency synthesis-
ers. The given examples will at a later stage be used to evaluate the frequency
synthesiser developed in this project. Typical characteristics will be compared to
show the added value of the new development.
[19] introduces an architecture which has low noise and consumes a small area
on chip. It is conﬁgured for a low frequency reference, however can be extended
to operations in the RF area.
The analogue PLL uses an active loop ﬁlter and can therefore omit the charge
pump. Two large resistors are used to emulate a small current normally provided
by a charge-pump. The disadvantage is, that the high resistance is prone to
thermal noise and thus e?ects the phase noise of the whole circuit. Therefore two
switches are added in series with the high resistances (see Figure 3.5), which close
only short before a pulse of the phase detector arrives and open short after that.
If that switching window is too small, the loop becomes unstable because of the
parasitic capacitances of the resistors, where charge is stored and ﬂows into the
op-amp, which results in ringing. If the window is long enough, the charge can
ﬂow back to the phase detector.
The windowing technique achieves a signiﬁcant noise reduction of 15dB com-
pared to the conventional architecture. [19]
Figure 3.5: Circuit proposed by [19] (from [19])
In the paper [20], a dual-loop frequency synthesiser is proposed which uses a
multi-phaseVCOinsteadoftheconventionalVCO.Theoverallcircuitissimilarto
the one shown previously in Figure 2.16. The multi-phase VCO provides signals
of four di?erent phases and thus has four outputs, which are fed into a multi-
phase divider. The circuit has a very good frequency resolution in comparison to
conventional dual-loop synthesisers. Compared to a conventional ??-modulated
fractional-N synthesiser, the phase noise is also much better.
The design was implemented on a FPGA and measurements were carried out
and compared to results of a conventional dual-loop frequency synthesiser. By
using the multi-phase VCO, either the loop bandwidth could be four times in-
243.3 Frequency Synthesisers
creased or a high frequency resolution could be achieved, according to the desired
application. [20]
In Yang et al. a mixed-signal frequency synthesiser is proposed, which operates at
around 9 GHz. Their goal was to design a low noise and low power system with a
high frequency output. To achieve this, a quadrature VCO, consisting of two LC
oscillators, with frequency doubling is used. For the frequency doubler, they use
a transformer. The block diagram is illustrated in Figure 3.6. [21]
The measurements gave a frequency output range of 8.8 GHz to 9.2 GHz with a
reference clock in the range of tenth of MHz. The measured phase noise at 1 MHz
o?set is -104.5 dBc/Hz for a 9.1 GHz output frequency. The synthesiser consumes
12 mW of power. [21]
Table 3.3 shows a comparison of several state of the art frequency synthesisers.

The architectures introduced in this chapter and Chapter 2.3 have proven useful
for many applications, but do not satisfy the criteria for the desired application of
253 State of the Art
this project’s design. Usually, PLLs produce a frequency on their output, which
is variable in a fairly large range, i.e. several hundreds of MHz. The frequency
synthesiser of this project will be used for cleaning clock signals impaired by jitter
and therefore has to produce a very stable and noise-free output of 2.5 GHz.
The mixer mainly compensates for inaccuracies in the LC oscillator, which might
have a magnitude of only several hundreds of Hz. For that reason, existing PLL
architectures are not suitable for the design.
To implement such a synthesiser, established components, such as the Gilbert
Cell and the cross-coupled LC oscillator, can be used to form a novel system. This
system and its speciﬁcation will be further described in the next chapter.
264 System Speciﬁcation and Design
This chapter will introduce the speciﬁcation given by Xintronix Ltd and describe
the design of all the components. The VerilogA code of the testbench blocks
will be explained as well as the transistor-level design of the LC oscillator and
the Gilbert Cell. The schematics will be shown and mathematically calculated
geometries will be compared to geometries, which lead to the desired function
of the circuit. Where di?culties occurred in the design, reasons and possible
solutions will be analysed. It will furthermore show, in which order the designing
was conducted and how the project progressed over time.

The input frequency for testing was chosen to be 5 MHz. The output of the
frequency synthesiser should be 2.5 GHz. A 5 GHz oscillator, which in reality will
be given by another PLL with an accuracy of± 100 ppm (= 0.01 %), provides the
274 System Speciﬁcation and Design
basic output frequency. Therefore it is divided by two and mixed with a correction
frequency which ranges from -250 kHz to 250 kHz with a 1 mHz resolution, to
balance the 100 ppm deviation, which corresponds to 250 kHz for the 2.5 GHz
signal.
From Xintronix’s speciﬁcation the lock time of the system, after which the
output matches the reference, can be very high, up to 1 minute.
The system will operate with a maximum supply voltage of 1.8 V± 10%. The
√
current available on the chip is 10 ?A± 2, which gives a range of 8.49 ?A ..
11.51 ?A. The temperature range in which all measurements were taken is from
-40 °C to 125 °C.

Table 4.1: General speciﬁcation
Thespeciﬁcationmainlydescribestheoverallparametersandinterfacesbetween
blocks. It leaves room for deciding on some values inside each block. These will
be further described and their chosen deﬁnition justiﬁed in the following sections.
At the beginning of the design phase, a testbench was created, which contained
simplemodelsforallthenecessarycomponentswritteninVerilogA.Thetestbench
was modiﬁed until a lock time was reached within a reasonable simulation time.
That required using parameters which don’t follow the speciﬁcation and would
not make sense in a real design but show that the system is working.
The next step was to make the models more realistic by including noise to the
most noise critical parts. That is on the one hand the input reference and on the
other hand the 5 GHz oscillator.
The above explained parts were done in cooperation with the complementary
projectdonebyShrutiGudi. Experiencesweresharedandthebehaviourofcertain
parts was discussed. However, the implementation was done separately and the
ﬁnal designs di?ered in several parts, which will be covered more deeply in the
next section, when alternative implementations are described.
Thesubsequentstageswereundertakencompletelyindependentofoneanother’s
projects.
284.2 Testbench Design
For this project, the oscillator was designed on transistor level. The architec-
ture had been chosen by Xintronix to be a cross-coupled LC design, as shown in
Chapter 3.1. The geometries were calculated and ﬁne tuned until the best results
in terms of PVT variations and phase noise were achieved.
Then, the Gilbert Cell mixer was designed. This was the most time consuming
part, as many factors inﬂuence the output and the mixer ﬁnally deﬁnes the output
signal and thus noise. Not only the geometries had to be chosen correctly, but
also the exact input signals had to be deﬁned to achieve the desired output.
Two Gilbert Cells were later connected together, to form the quadrature fre-
quency converter. That required redesigning the transistor geometries, load resis-
tors and input levels, to optimise the output.
Finally, the divider for the LC oscillator was designed in VerilogA and the
frequencyconvertercouldbeconnectedtotheoscillator. Thissystemagainneeded
redesigning of single parts, mainly of the mixer, for optimisation purposes.
The environment for the development of both, VerilogA models and transistor
level schematics, is Cadence Virtuoso. It is used for designing and simulations
of several kinds. For components such as resistors, capacitors and voltage or
current sources, models from the ideal analogue library of Cadence were chosen.
The transistors and the inductance for the LC oscillator were taken from the
gpdk180nm library. This is a generic library, which models realistic behaviour
but without having underlying parameters extracted from real measurements of
fabricated circuits.
4.2 Testbench Design
The testbench includes VerilogA models of the components. Firstly, all parts were
modelled and later, speciﬁc parts were replaced by real circuits.
Figure 4.2: Testbench schematic
All oscillators used in the testbench, including the input reference and the LC
oscillator, are in the beginning replaced by ideal voltage sources from the analogue
294 System Speciﬁcation and Design
library of Cadence. The remaining components, which are modelled in VerilogA
are the phase frequency detector, the signal processor, the digital-to-analogue con-
verter – later a ?? modulator with a low pass ﬁlter – furthermore the quadrature
frequency converter and the feedback divider. The code for these models can be
found in the Appendix.
The phase detector is implemented in a way, that the output is positive if the
reference phase is ahead of the feedback and negative if the reference phase is
behind the feedback. It compares the occurrence of rising edges of both signals
and infers from that the phase relation of the two frequencies. The change of
the pulse width over time gives information on the frequency relation of the two
signals. The output has three states, positive, neutral and negative.
Alternatively, the phase detector could be implemented as a subtractor, which
forms the di?erence of the reference and the feedback signal and has also three
output levels. Or it could be an XOR, which outputs a high level if the signals
have di?erent levels and a low level, if the signals have the same level. Another
approach would be an analogue multiplier with again three output levels. These
implementations would also require a di?erent signal processor design.
The signal processor samples the phase detector’s output signal at certain time
steps, the frequency of which was chosen to be 500 MHz. During the sampling
the average over the input samples is calculated over a deﬁned range, which was
chosen to be 100. That average value is then compared to the previous average,
which was stored internally, and according to whether the di?erence is positive
or negative, the output 32-bit digital value is increased or decreased. The digital
value is equivalent to the control voltage of a VCO. Its absolute value controls the
frequency that is produced by the ??-DAC.
To translate the signals from a subtractor-, multiplier- or XOR-phase detector,
the signal processor has to be designed in a slightly di?erent way. It would again
sample its input and take the average over a certain time interval. The average
highlevel?lowlevel
should ideally be . Depending on the deviation from that ideal av-
2
erage, the signal processor increases or decreases the digital word. In lock, the
reference and the feedback frequency would therefore be in quadrature, as that
relation forces the output error of the phase detector to have equally distributed
high and low times and therefore the ideal average.
The DAC model was not implemented as a ??-modulator because that task
forms part of the complementary project. In the simpliﬁed model, the DAC sam-
ples its input, which is the digital word coming from the signal processor, at a
frequency of 5 MHz. That gives the signal processor enough time for producing an
updated value at its output, as it runs at 500 MHz but in intervals of 100, which
leaves an update rate of 5 MHz, according to Equation 4.8. The DAC has a free
running frequency which can be arbitrarily chosen. It forms the initial value for
the IF mixer input and therefore determines, what the initial feedback frequency
304.2 Testbench Design
on system start-up is. In the testbench, it is chosen to be 0 Hz, as ideally the LO
frequency is exactly 2.5 GHz. The word is set to be 0 on system start-up.
The quadrature converter performs the ideal mathematical function behind a
mixer architecture by multiplying the voltages of the two input frequencies at each
iteration. The equation behind the model is:
V = (V (f )·V (f )) ? (V (f )·V (f )) (4.1)

I Q
The divider counts the rising edges on its input and depending on the divisor,
which can be set as a parameter, outputs a rising or falling edge for the divided
signal.

314 System Speciﬁcation and Design
Simulating the system with the actual values is not possible on the university
machines, because the locking takes fairly long. The simulation of a period of
25 ?s takes approximately 40 minutes in real time and produces amounts of data
that can’t be handled by the PCs. However, to show that the system is still
working, the above explained speciﬁcation was modiﬁed so that locking can be
reached within around 3 ?s simulation time. The results are shown in Figure 4.3.
Figure a) shows the overall locking procedure and Figure b) shows a detailed view
of the locking which happens within the ﬁrst 3 ?s. After that time, the feedback
frequency oscillates around the actual value. The oscillation shown in the graph is
very high. That is due to the chosen resolution of the DAC, which is set very low
in this example, to show the circuit is working. The detailed view shows, how the
desired frequency is stepwise approached. Comparing the graph to Figure 2.14
makes clear that the result is similar to the expected outcome.
The values which were taken for the example in the graph are summarised in

4.3 LC Oscillator Design
This section will discuss the architecture of the chosen LC oscillator in detail and
explain the geometries of the components mathematically as well as by means of
simulations. Two approaches were made in terms of the architecture which will
be compared.
Asmentionedinprevioussections,theoscillatorwasspeciﬁedtobeofaLCtype,
which means that the oscillation is caused by a resonator consisting of an inductor
(L) and a capacitor (C). The commonly used architecture for that type is a cross-
coupled NMOS-PMOS architecture. The original version shown in Figure 4.4a
was designed and compared to the design in Figure 4.4b, which has two additional
transistors. The di?erences in the results will be discussed in Chapter 5.
(a) Original architecture (b) Modiﬁed architecture
Figure 4.4: Schematics of the LC oscillator
The transistors used for the design as well as all further designs were taken from
thegpdk180nmlibraryprovidedbyCadenceasagenericlibrary. Processvariation
corner cases are available in that library for the MOSFETs, which were used in
the PVT variation analysis and will be further explained in the next chapter.
The inductor was also taken from that library, but process corner cases are not
available. It is a spiral inductor with a square shape, which is shown in Figure 4.5.
Theinductance isdeterminedby settingtheinner radiusR, theinductor width W,
the space S and the number of turns N and can be calculated as in Equation 4.10.

Figure 4.5: Layout view of the inductor from the gpdk180nm library
Two di?erent inductor values were taken to show how they inﬂuence phase noise
and PVT variations. For both values, the inner radius is 20 ?m, the width of the
inductor 8 ?m and the spacing 2 ?m. With 3.5 turns, the inductance is 1.13 nH
and with 6.5 turns it is 4.06 nH according to Equation 4.10.
The capacitor is an ideal model from the analogLib standard Cadence library.
The output frequency of the oscillator is determined by the geometries of the
inductor and the capacitor as follows:
1
f = √ (4.11)
0
2π LC
The desired frequency of the oscillator is 5 GHz. That leaves a capacitance
of 897 fF for an inductance of 1.13 nH and a capacitance of 250 fF for an in-
ductance of 4.06 nH according to Equation 4.11. Due to parasitics, these values
need to be adjusted by means of simulations. The original version (Figure 4.4a)
needs a capacitance of 241.2 fF for an inductance of 4.06 nH and outputs a fre-
quency of 5.0002 GHz. For the version with the extra transistors (Figure 4.4b)
and L = 1.13 nH a capacitance of 889.7 fF produces an output frequency of
4.99999 GHz, for L = 4.06 nH a capacitance of 240.7 fF produces 5.0001 GHz.
Figure 4.6 summarises the dimensions for all used components of the extended
architecture. The original architecture uses the same dimensions for its compo-
nents except for the capacitance, which is chosen as mentioned above.
The output of the oscillator with the extra transistors is shown in Figure 4.7.
There, the blue trace shows the actual output and the red trace shows the ideal
output given by

The real and ideal trace have the same frequency but are phase shifted, which is
not important, as it does not a?ect the functionality.

The oscillator needs an impulse at the beginning on one node of the di?eren-
tial output to induce the energy which will oscillate from one node to the other.
Without that impulse, there is no oscillation. For the shown simulations, a 1 V
impulse was used in the beginning. This is done by a special feature called "ini-
tial condition" in the analogue design environment (ADE) in Cadence used for
simulations.
The stabilisation time for the LC oscillator with L = 4.06 nH where the full am-
plitude is reached is approximately 60 ns, as shown in the graph. For L = 1.13 nH
the time to stabilisation is approximately 300 ns. That is due to the higher ca-
pacitance used in the LC tank.
For the original architecture, the time is around 20 ns. The reason for that
being shorter than the stabilisation time of the extended architecture is, that
using less transistors means having less parasitic capacitances and therefore a
faster stabilisation.
The W/L ratio of the transistors can be determined approximately, by using
the equation for current ﬂowing through a transistor. All transistors should be in
saturation for correct operation so that Equation 4.13 is valid.

k for the NMOS is here approximated by 100 ?A/V . The drain current of the
transistors is 100 ?A. That leaves a W/L ratio of 50 for NMOS and a width of
9?m for a length of 180 nm. To lower the parasitic capacitance which slows down
the switching speed of the transistors and extends the time needed for stabilisation
of the oscillator, the width was chosen to be only 1 ?m for the NMOS transistors
and 2.5 the size for the PMOS. A smaller W/L ratio has also a positive e?ect on
PVT variations, which will be further explained in Chapter 5.
4.4 Gilbert Cell and Frequency Converter Design
In this section the design of the Gilbert Cell mixer and the frequency converter
built from that will be explained. The ideal mathematical calculation of the
geometries is illustrated and deviations from that in the actual design will be ex-
plained. The output waveforms will be shown and discussed and the necessary
inputs for the mixers to produce a reasonable output are mentioned.
The netlist driven schematic for the quadrature frequency converter in a test-
bench, which was created in Cadence Virtuoso, is shown in Figure 4.8. The
schematic of the upper mixer "GC" is shown in Figure 4.9. The lower mixer
"GC2" contains a similar circuit with the same dimensions but without the re-
sistors to the supply voltage. The reason for that is, that load-sharing is used
for subtraction of the I and Q signals in the frequency converter as explained in
Chapter 2.2 and previously shown in Figure 2.12. With that design the outputs
of the mixer cells "GC" and "GC2" can be directly connected and form the desired
overall circuit.
The dimensions are listed in Figure 4.10. All transistors have the minimum

over each block. For the transistors of the tail current mirror and the di?eren-
tial transconductance pair with the low frequency applied, the desired overdrive
voltage is again about 200 mV. The upper switching transistors need to be sized
according to their on-resistance. They inﬂuence the linearity of the mixer. The
resistance of the load resistors deﬁnes the amplitude range of the output signal,
the higher it is, the higher is the voltage swing on the output due to the incresed
gain. The following calculations show the ideal parameters, where I = 10 ?A

The width of the switching transistors M3 to M6 was chosen to be smaller than
the calculated value, to make the parasitic capacitance as small as possible due
to the high frequency applied to their gates. This allows a cleaner and faster
switching and a better shape on the output.
The width of the di?erential pair transistors, however, was chosen to be larger
than the calculated value, to increase the voltage swing on the output and improve
the accuracy of the output signal.
The correct functionality of the mixer strongly depends on the input signals
and their levels and amplitudes. It is important that the transistors M1 and
M2 are only conducting at the same time for a very short period, ideally not
at all. Therefore, the bias level needs to be around the threshold voltage of the
394 System Speciﬁcation and Design
transistors. A high amplitude of the input IF signal on v results in a cut o? of
in2
the output signal, because there is not enough headroom. That is, the amplitude
needs to be very small. It is also limited by the linearity of the mixer. The
amplitude needs to be in the linear region, which is further explained in Chapter 5.
The bias voltage ofv is 700 mV and the amplitude 30 mV for all simulations,
in2
as these values have proven to give best results.
The switching transistors M3 to M6 can have a higher amplitude which means
they can have a higher bias voltage as well. For them it is again important that
ideally two transistors on the same branch of the mixer are not conducting at the
same time. Thus, the bias voltage, which is created by pulling up the decoupled
nets through resistors of 5 kΩ, is chosen to be 1 V. The amplitude is 450 mV.
Figure 4.12: Mixer output; left: overall shape, right: zoomed in; purple: real
output, red: ideal output
The output signal of one mixer is shown in Figure 4.12. The purple trace shows
the output of the circuit and the red trace shows the ideal output according to
Equation 2.9.
The overall shape di?ers slightly from the ideal trace, which is due to transistors
in both branches of the mixer circuit being in the "on"-state at the same time and
also due to non-ideal port isolation. That is, the port’s signals leak through to
their neighbouring ports and interfere with their signals.
Figure 4.13 shows the output of the whole frequency converter, where two
Gilbert Cells share a resistive load. The upper graph shows the overall signal
and details the amplitude, the lower graph shows the frequency in detail.
For the same reasons the mixer output di?ers from the ideal, the amplitude of
the overall converter output is not steady. The IF frequency is leaking through
and causes a variation in the amplitude. This will be explained and shown in
further detail again in Chapter 5.

This chapter has described the design of the main components of this project.
The geometries of the components were chosen based on mathematical analysis
and adjustments were made based on the simulation results. The characteristics,
which are directly related to the designs, will be explained and discussed in the
next chapter.
414 System Speciﬁcation and Design
425 Results and Evaluation
The design process goes hand in hand with simulations of several characteristics
which have to be taken into account and need to be constantly observed. The key
characteristics for all circuits, which have been already explained in Chapter 2,
were simulated, measured and plotted with spectreRF in Cadence Virtuoso. This
chapter will show the phase noise for the LC oscillator and discuss PVT variations.
For the mixer and the quadrature frequency converter noise, linearity, isolation
and gain are shown. At the end of each section, the design will be compared to
recent publications and thereby its quality will be evaluated.
5.1 Oscillator Characteristics
The analogue LC oscillator designed as described in Chapter 4.3 is evaluated in
this section. Phase noise and PVT variations are used to characterise the quality
of the design. The accuracy of the output frequency is the major concern. All
measurements were carried out for the original architecture and the modiﬁed one
with the two extra transistors for comparison. For the extended architecture, two
di?erent values for the inductor and therefore the capacitor as well were used to
show how the performance di?ers. The settings in spectreRF for the simulations
are described based on the Cadence Manual [25, 26].
Figure 5.1 shows the relative phase noise of the original cross-coupled LC oscil-
lator for an inductor with L = 4.06 nH. The red trace shows the statistical average
of the phase noise at 27 °C and 1.8 V supply voltage. The worst case is shown in
green and is achieved with a temperature of 125 °C at a supply voltage of 1.98 V
(= 1.8 V + 10 %). The process variations were set to fast for both NMOS and
PMOS transistors (FF).
The best case is shown in orange, where the temperature is -40 °C, the voltage
is 1.68 V (= 1.8 V - 10 %) and the corner cases are set to FS, so fast for NMOS
and slow for PMOS transistors.
At1kHz, theaveragephasenoiseis-33.3dBc/Hz, at1MHzitis-118.8dBc/Hz,
the best and worst case di?er by up to± 5 dBc/Hz from that value.
The simulation was done using a pss (= periodic steady state) and a pnoise (pe-
riodic noise) analysis in spectreRF of the Cadence analogue design environment.
The pss analysis has to be performed in order to run a pnoise analysis prior to
that. It is the equivalent to a DC analysis but with periodic signals.

Figure 5.1: Phase Noise of the original oscillator architecture for L = 4.06 nH
As there are no periodic input signals to the oscillator, no fundamental frequen-
cies are displayed in the setup window for the pss analysis. The beat frequency
speciﬁes an approximate of the expected output frequency and is set to 5 GHz in
this case. The number of output harmonics was chosen to be 6. The higher this
value is, the more accurate is the phase noise later, because more tones are taken
into account for calculation. The stabilisation time is set to 1 ?s to allow time
for the oscillator to reach its stable output frequency. For the oscillator there is a
special feature in the pss analysis. To activate it the box called "oscillator" needs
to be ticked o?. This allows to specify the output nodes out+ and out- as shown
in Figure 4.4a.
The pnoise analysis sweeps the frequency over a speciﬁed range and plots the
noise in a way that can be chosen from several settings. In this case, the sweep
type is relative, so that the phase noise is plotted as an o?set from the oscillation
frequency of 5 GHz. The sweep range is chosen to be from 1 kHz to 100 MHz
on a logarithmic scale with 501 points per decade to get an accurate graph. The
maximum number of sidebands is set to 6 to match the number of output har-
monics of the oscillator and take these into account for the noise analysis. The
output is set to "voltage" and the di?erential nodes of the oscillator out+ and out-
are chosen in the schematic. The input is set to "none" as there is no input and
the noise type is set to "sources" to achieve the output shown in Figure 5.1. By
setting the noise type to jitter, the jitter is automatically calculated and output

as an absolute value with a unit of fs (= 10 s) or even as (= 10 s).

cases set to FF. The red trace shows the maximum frequency with 5.00129 GHz
at -40°C, 1.68 V supply voltage and for SF as process variation. This means that
the fundamental frequency only varies +0.02 % and -0.10 %. That is very low for
an LC oscillator and in reality can’t be achieved. The reason these values are so
low is, that there is no process variation model for the inductor in the design kit
used for this project. The inductor, however, varies a lot over process variations.
A realistic accuracy would be several percent starting from± 5 %.
Figure 5.3: Phase noise for L = 1.13 nH with the modiﬁed architecture
For the modiﬁed cross-coupled architecture of the oscillator the phase noise
average, best and worst case results are plotted in Figure 5.3 and 5.4 for two
di?erent inductances.
The average relative phase noise is represented by the red trace and at 1 kHz
for the circuit with an inductance of L = 1.13 nH it is -32.9 dBc/Hz and at an
o?set of 1 MHz it is -119.6 dBc/Hz. The best case at -40°C with a supply voltage
of 1.68 V and process variations set to FS is shown in orange and the worst case
455 Results and Evaluation
Figure 5.4: Phase noise for L = 4.06 nH with the modiﬁed architecture
at 125°C and 1.98 V supply voltage with FF set as corner case is shown in green.
Comparing this graph to the previous graph of the original architecture, it can
be seen, that the average phase noise is slightly better than before measured at
higher o?sets from the oscillation frequency. At 1 kHz it is very similar.
The deviation of the best and worst case according to PVT variations is however
greater in the new architecture with approximately± 15 dBc/Hz. This can be
explained by the number of transistors. Because the extended architecture uses
two more transistors, the whole circuit is more prone to PVT variations than the
circuit with less transistors.
The oscillator with an inductance of L = 4.06 nH has an average phase noise of
-22.4 dBc/Hz at 1 kHz and -108.0 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz, again shown as a red trace
in Figure 5.4. The orange trace shows the best case and the green trace the worst
case both under the same circumstances as in the previous graph with the lower
inductance. The variation of these from the average is again around± 15 dBc/Hz.
The circuit with the lower inductance shows a better performance in terms of
phase noise. The PVT variations are similar, but again under the condition that
there is no inductor model for process variations so that the inductor’s size is not
taken into account and therefore leads to similar results.
The variation of the output frequency of the extended oscillator with process
and temperature variations is illustrated in Figure 5.5 and 5.6 for the two di?erent
inductances.
All measurements weretaken with asupply voltageof 1.8 V.Thered traces show
the average process corners at the three di?erent temperatures, the orange traces
show the corner cases for fast NMOS and slow PMOS transistors. The green
traces show the frequencies for both in fast mode. The pink traces represent the
SF setting and the blue traces the SS process variations.

Figure 5.6: Process and temperature variation of the frequency for L = 4.06 nH
475 Results and Evaluation
It can be generally seen, that for the lower inductance, the frequency is less
stable. However for the larger inductor, the deviation from the desired frequency
with the process and temperature variation is larger.
Figure 5.7 and 5.8 show only the best and worst case, also taking a 10 % devia-
tion of the supply voltage into account. The centre freqeuncy for the circuit with
an inductance of 1.13 nH is 4.99999 GHz. The worst case deviation is + 0.09 %
and - 0.04 %. For the oscillator with the 4.06 nH inductance, the centre frequency
for the speciﬁed design is 5.0001 GHz with a deviation of + 0.40 % and - 0.16 %
in the worst cases.

Figure 5.8: Worst case PVT variations of the frequency for L = 4.06 nH
The pss analysis which was run to gain the phase noise graphs, also gives a volt-
age spectrum of the magnitude of the harmonic frequencies. These are plotted in
Figure 5.9 and 5.10 for the extended architecture. The peak is at 5 GHz with
approximately 5 dB for both inductances.
Table 5.1 summarises the characteristics of the three in this project proposed
designs and compares them to recent publications.

495 Results and Evaluation
Taking only the best case into account, the extended architecture with an in-
ductance of 1.13 nH shows the best results. Considering the worst case, the simple
cross-coupled oscillator has a better phase noise performance. The best case re-
sults beat all the mentioned publications by up to 15 dBc/Hz. Overall, all three
designs in this project show reasonable phase noise results which can compete
against other designs.
The publications do not mention any variations or worst case values for their

there are only a few papers considering PVT variations, most designs omit these,
becausetheresultscanbeverypoor, ifthedesignisnotmatchedproperly. Further
it is to be mentioned, that [12–14] took their measurements from real circuits and
not only the simulations as in [11] and in this project’s design.

505.2 Gilbert Cell Characteristics
5.2 Gilbert Cell Characteristics
This section will explain the results of the Gilbert Cell simulations based on the
design speciﬁcations in the previous chapter. Thereby, characteristics such as
conversion gain, noise ﬁgure, linearity and isolation are analysed. Where possible
adequate mathematical equations are used for comparison to the simulative re-
sults.
The conversion gain dependent on the input power of the LO port is plotted
in Figure 5.11. It shows the gain from the input power to the output power. At
the chosen amplitude on the LO input, which is 450 mV, the conversion gain has
a magnitude of 7.6 dB. The maximum value is around 13 dB, but to reach that
value the amplitude of the LO signal needs to be higher than 1 V.
The conversion gain was also tested for PVT variations, but these were very
small, there was nearly no deviation from the mean curve.

515 Results and Evaluation
The deviation from the 7.6 dB can be explained by the switching not being
perfectandbecausetheoverdrivevoltagemaybeslightlydi?erentfromthedesired
0.2 V.
To measure the conversion gain, again spectreRF analyses are used. Firstly a
pss analysis similar to the one described in the previous section is done. Before
setting up the simulation, the IF port needs to be set from sine wave to DC signal
and the small signal parameter for the magnitude of the port, used later during a
PAC (periodic AC) analysis, is set to 1. In the pss settings, there should be only
one entry under fundamental tones, which is the LO port. The beat frequency
is 2.5 GHz, as the expected output of the mixer is close to that value (ideally
2.500250 GHz). The number of harmonics was set to two for this simulation and
the amplitude of the LO signal is swept from 0 to 2 V.
Additionally, a pac analysis needs to be set up. The frequency range is there
set to single point with the 250 kHz of the IF input. The number of sidebands is
the same as the number of harmonics speciﬁed in the pss analysis, so 2.
The noise was measured over the amplitude at the LO port and as a relative
o?set from the output frequency over the frequency range. Figure 5.12 shows the
former and Figure 5.13 the latter.
Figure 5.12: Noise Figure depending on the LO input power
In Figure 5.12, it can be seen that the phase noise is very high for amplitudes
at the LO port below 0.25 V and then reaches a near steady state around 40 dB.
At the chosen LO amplitude of 450 mV, the noise is 40.2 dB.
The relative noise ﬁgure is 36 dB at 1 MHz o?set from the centre frequency
under standard circumstances as shown in Figure 5.13. Figure 5.14 points out the
PVT variations of the noise. The red traces show the cases for 125 °C, the green
traces for 27°C and the blue traces for -40°C. The process cases SF and FS were
omitted because there are no PMOS transistors in the circuit and therefore SS and
FF are su?cient, as the second letter always refers to PMOS type transistors. The
lowest of each block of traces is always for the FF case, the middle trace for the
standard process variation setting and the upper trace for the SS case. For better
525.2 Gilbert Cell Characteristics
Figure 5.13: Realtive Noise Figure over frequency
readability, voltage variations were not plotted except for the black trace, which
was measured for 125 °C at 1.62 V and with slow transistors and a magnitude of
47.7 dB at an o?set of 1 MHz. This is the worst case noise. All other voltage
variations were somewhere in between best and worst case and always quite close
to the corresponding 1.8 V trace. The best case is for fast transistors at -40 °C
and 1.8 V supply voltage with a value of 28.8 dB at an o?set of 1 MHz from the
output frequency of the mixer.
Figure 5.14: Worst case relative Noise Figure with PVT variations
Noise is measured with the same pss setup as the conversion gain. Additionally
a pnoise analysis is needed, which is speciﬁed with a frequency sweep range from
1 kHz to 100 MHz. The number of sidebands is again the same as the number
of harmonics in the pss analysis, so 2. The output is set to "voltage" and the RF
di?erential output nodes are chosen from the schematic. The input is given by the
IF port. The reference sideband is the ﬁrst and the noise type is set to sources.
As with these settings, either the LO amplitude and the frequency are swept,
it can be chosen over which the noise is plotted.
535 Results and Evaluation
Figure 5.15: 1 dB compression point for the mixer
The linearity of the mixer is expressed by the 1 dB compression point and the
input referred third order intercept point. For this, the mixer output is expressed
as a Taylor series with the third polynomial as the highest polynomial for sim-
pliﬁcation. The intersection of the ﬁrst and the third polynomial forms the third
order intercept point and is a comparable metric for linearity of di?erent mixers.
Figure 5.15 shows the plot of the mixer RF output power over the IF input
power in blue. The linear region of the trace is extrapolated and shown in black
for a 1 dB o?set. The intersection of both traces gives the 1 dB compression
point which is at -17 dB. This is the point up to which the mixer is deemed to be
working linearly.
Figure 5.16: Input third order intercept point for the mixer
The construction of the third order intercept point is illustrated in Figure 5.16.
The blue trace shows the ﬁrst order approximation and the red trace the third
order approximation. The extrapolation of the linear regions of both gives an
intercept point at an input power of -8 dBm.
545.2 Gilbert Cell Characteristics
To simulate the IIP3 and 1 dB-compression point, a qpss (= quasi-periodic
steady state) analysis is run together with a qpac (= quasi-periodic AC) analysis.
The di?erence to the pss and pac analysis is that with the quasi-periodic analyses
twotonesimulationscanbedone. Thatmeansonecansimulatethemixerwithout
setting the IF input to DC.
For this simulation, the amplitude of the IF port is set as a variable "aif" and
speciﬁed in dB, not as before in Volts. The small signal PAC parameter is set
to the same variable "aif", so that when the amplitude is swept, the small signal
amplitude is swept as well. In the qpss settings window, the LO port is speciﬁed
as a large tone with 2 harmonics, which is su?cient for displaying the desired
output. The IF port is speciﬁed as a moderate tone with also 2 harmonics. The
variable "aif" is swept from -40 to 5 dB. The qpac analysis is set to a single point
frequency range at a frequency close to the IF frequency, in this case 260 kHz.
The sidebands are chosen to be 2.5 GHz + (250 kHz± (260 kHz - 250 kHz), so
2.50024 GHz and 2.50026 GHz. These are the ﬁrst and third order approxima-
tions, which are displayed in Figure 5.16.
As could already be seen in Figure 4.13, the amplitude of the converter is not
constant, as it would be in the ideal case. That means that the IF frequency is
leaking through. The relation of the leaking through signal to the overall signal
is called carrier suppression. The carrier suppresion is mathematically deﬁned as:
   
A
CarrierSuppression = 20·log (5.4)

B
where A is the maximum peak-to-peak amplitude of the overall output signal and
B is the peak-to-peak amplitude of the leaking through signal [27].
In this design it gives:

Figure 5.17: Isolation from the IF port to the RF port depending on the LO input
amplitude
555 Results and Evaluation
The isolation from the IF port to the RF port over the LO amplitude is shown
in Figure 5.17. The value at 450 mV is -94 dB, which is the maximum of the
curve. This is a fairly small value and explains, why the IF signal is still visible
on the output.
Table 5.2 summarises the simulation results described in this section and com-
pares them to recent publications introduced in Chapter 3.2. The di?erence from
the mixers from publications is, that they are down-converting to a low frequency,
which means that their inputs are in the same high frequency range. This design
has a high and a low frequency input, which is more complex to design and is
also reﬂected in the results. The noise ﬁgure is higher than for the publications.
The conversion gain is lower, but still there is no conversion loss. The IIP3 is also
lower, which means the designed mixer is less linear. For [18], there are no noise
values available, but in terms of gain and linearity, the values are very close to
this design. The overall results achieved in this project are reasonable and can be
worked with. Improvement might be done in the future.

566 Conclusion and Outlook
6.1 Summary
In this project, a novel PLL was developed, ﬁrst as an ideal VerilogA model with
parts later replaced by more realistic models or circuits on transistor level. The
single blocks which form the PLL are based on established designs, which have
been used for years in integrated circuits. The novelty is in the interaction of these
blocks. A ??-modulator followed by a quadrature frequency converter replace the
conventional VCO. A signal processor translates the phase-frequency relation of
the input reference of the PLL and the fed back output into a digital word, which
then controls the system output frequency to be exactly 2.5 GHz. These 2.5 GHz
are composed of a by two divided 5 GHz LC oscillator with a certain variation
which is compensated by a frequency generated by the ??-DAC in a range of
1 mHz up to 250 kHz. The main implementation in this part of the project
focused on the LC oscillator and the quadrature frequency converter. Another
project related to this system implemented the ??-modulator and a low-pass
ﬁlter.
A testbench was developed, showing that the overall system works. However,
the simulation time was very high and the computer lab PCs could not handle
the amount of data produced. Therefore, the values for characterising the single
blocks such as sample rates and resolutions were set to values other than the
speciﬁed ones, to produce an output showing the PLL working.
TheLCoscillatordevelopedinthisprojectisbasedonthecross-coupledNMOS-
PMOS architecture. A variation was tested with two extra transistors and com-
pared to the original architecture. Under best case circumstances, the new archi-
tecture gives the best results in terms of noise. Compared to recent papers, the
results are competitive and show even better values. The best case phase noise
achieved was measured at 1 MHz o?set from the centre frequency with a magni-
tude of -133.3 dBc/Hz, the worst case at the same o?set was -92.9 dBc/Hz, but for
di?erent geometries in the design. The oscillator was tested for PVT variations
and gave a maximum deviation of 0.4 % in the worst case. This result does not
include process variations of the inductor.
The quadrature frequency converter is composed of two Gilbert Cell mixers
sharing their resistive load to produce the di?erence of both individual mixer
outputs. The mixer design was challenging in a way, that a very low frequency,
which is close to DC, is mixed with a very high frequency. This case is rarely
discussed in publications. Most mixers are used for down-converting to a low
576 Conclusion and Outlook
frequency, this project’s mixer does both up- and down-conversion, depending on
the direction of the deviation of the LC oscillator’s frequency. The mixer has a
slightly higher noise ﬁgure than comparable designs, which however are down-
converting to a low frequency. The linearity is compared to some cases given over
a smaller range and the gain is a bit lower than for other designs.
The implementations satisfy the needs of the system for a ﬁrst design step.
Improvements which could be worked on in the future are discussed in the next
section.
6.2 Future work
To gain more realistic results for the oscillator over process variations, an inductor
model needs to be developed, which reﬂects its realistic behaviour, in case the
layers are not perfectly produced and where parasitics are present. This model
would help understand how good the design really is in terms of PVT variations,
as this beside others characterises the quality.
The overall noise of the quadrature frequency converter could not be simulated
due to limitations of spectreRF. For example, it can’t simulate a circuit with more
than two di?erent ports in sine-mode. The current testbench for the converter
needs four. Another issue is, that models written in VerilogA can’t be simulated.
WhenimplementingfurtherblocksofthePLLontransistorlevel, thewholedesign
can be simulated. A ﬁrst block would be the D-Flip-Flop divider used to divide
down the oscillator frequency of 5 GHz and producing quadrature related streams.
The Gilbert Cell produces an output with the IF frequency leaking through.
Improvingtheisolationandnoisebyfurtheranalysingthecircuitonaverydetailed
level could help improve the output in terms of leakage.
It was not possible simulating the whole system with its speciﬁed values over
a reasonable simulation time. Using a strong PC over several days, the system
might be simulated.
On a later stage, the LC oscillator will be replaced by another PLL producing
a very accurate frequency so that only very low frequencies will be needed to
compensate it and gain the exact 2.5 GHz output.

62Appendix A
A.1 ??-digital-to-analogue-modulator
The ??-modulator in the PLL developed in this project translates the 32-bit
digital input from the signal processor to a pulse-density modulated signal, which
is then low-pass-ﬁltered to result in a sinusoidal signal. The ??-modulator acts as
a quantiser, which translates the high resolution input from the signal processor
intoalower-resolutionsignal. Duetothedecreasingresolution, thesignalbecomes
more inaccurate. The added inaccuracy is known as quantisation error and adds
to the noise on the output signal. The quantisation error is negatively fed back to
compensate itself in the next cycle. Oversampling is used as a technique to move
the noise out of the band of interest to a higher frequency, which is called noise
shaping. Usually, an oversampling rate of 64 or 128 is used, which is much higher
than the Nyquist rate, being only twice the baseband frequency. [28, 29]
The ??-modulator speciﬁed for this project’s PLL is a second-order type as
shown in Figure A.2, which has the advantage of lowering the noise, however, it
is more likely to be unstable. The oversampling rate was chosen to be 64 and the
quantiser is 1-bit wide.

A low-pass ﬁlter transforms the pulse-density-modulated signal into a sine wave.
The architecture of the ﬁlter was chosen to be a second-order Sallen-Key type,
illustrated in Figure A.3.

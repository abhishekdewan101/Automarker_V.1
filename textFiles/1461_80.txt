Abstract
Compositing is an artistic and scientiﬁc challenge which attempts to convincingly 
combine multiple visual elements into a single image. Previsualisation is a cost-
effective time-saving function to visualise complex scenes before committing 
resources to a full-scale production. This project presents a novel previsualisation 
tool for compositing synthetic objects into captured photographs. The rendering 
takes place as augmented reality, driven by appropriate context-aware data relating a 
model to its environment. The novelty and added-value of this solution lies in 
reducing the information gap between the composited elements and in producing 
instantaneous visual feedback to a compositor. The project is implemented on a 
commercial mobile device using the latest hardware sensors and graphics software 
available.
Contributions & Achievements
I designed a novel compositing system which bypasses a traditional image post-
•
processing stage in favour of a ﬂexible, real-time rendering approach.
I devised a simplistic method for recreating environment shading information for 
•
use in colour-based compositing. I have named the collected data colour priors 
[pp. 19-20].
I have extended the hemisphere lighting algorithm with device sensor data and 
•
colour priors to simulate ambient occlusion, resulting in a technique I call 
hemisphere occlusion [pp. 24-26].
I have thoroughly investigated the capabilities of a modern mobile device and 
•
used my ﬁndings to bridge an information gap between the current state of 
compositing on embedded systems compared to desktop PCs.

CC1. Introduction
1.1. Project Overview
Compositing is an artistic and scientiﬁc challenge which attempts to convincingly combine 
multiple visual elements captured or rendered in separate environments into a single image. 
The costly information gap between the source and target material has kept this task as a 
largely manual process tackled by seasoned professionals working from inferred knowledge 
and artistic judgement.
Previsualisation is a cost-effective and time-saving function to visualise complex scenes 
before committing resources to a full-scale production. It is extremely helpful to the whole 
ﬁlm crew as a powerful means of communication and collaboration. After all, the ﬁlm 
industry produces a mountainous series of images above all else.
With the current quality and availability of computer-generated imagery (CGI), more and 
more projects are using 3D models throughout the whole production pipeline, from pre-
production (previsualisation) to post-production (compositing). 
This project combines these two stages into a single process, producing a novel 
previsualisation tool for compositing synthetic objects into captured photographs, with a 
preview-quality ﬁnish. 
The rendering takes place as augmented reality, driven by appropriate context-aware data 
relating a model to its environment. The novelty and added-value of this solution lies in 
reducing the information gap between the composited elements and in delivering 
instantaneous visual feedback to a compositor. The application mostly focuses on outdoor, 
daytime scenes due to the relative simplicity of a dual illumination environment (sunlight 
and daylight), compared to more complex indoor scenes with multiple unknown 
illumination sources.
The project is implemented on a commercial mobile device using the latest hardware sensors 
and graphics software available. This thesis documents the work carried out by this project 
from the initial research review, through to the design and development, and ﬁnally to the 
analysis and evaluation.

Contextual Caveat
3
This project makes use of very new technologies and computing concepts that are yet to be 
fully explored. Therefore, it does not directly continue a particular line of research or 
previous work, rather, it develops a new point of reference for future applications. 
Furthermore, many algorithms and techniques are implemented from renowned solutions, 
but in these cases the challenge lies in adapting them to ﬁt a new approach. 
While mobile devices carry a plethora of sensors and data, they are, for the time being, 
massively restricted in terms of memory and processing power. This project navigates this 
largely uncharted territory and attempts to ﬁnd the right balance between these two 
extremes, always keeping a common goal in sight: real-time, context-aware compositing.
With the contextual caveat issued, this section examines the related work surrounding this 
project in scientiﬁc literature, mobile apps, and non-commercial technology.
2.1. Scientiﬁc Literature
In preparation for this thesis I conducted an extensive research review [Rendon Cepeda, 
2012] in order to understand the signiﬁcance, novelty, and added value of this project in 
relation to previous work in three separate areas of computing: context-awareness,  3D 
graphics, and image-processing. These areas are still quite broad and hence further 
examined in terms of photography, lighting/shading, and compositing, respectively. Below I 
present a summary of my most relevant ﬁndings.
2.1.1. Context-Aware Photography
Context-awareness is a branch of ubiquitous computing in which a device can both sense 
and react to its environment. Location and mobility are the main exponents of this ﬁeld, 
with modern devices providing instant access to integrated sensors such as the gyroscope 
and accelerometer. This availability allows a device to be constantly aware of its relationship 
with the environment, and hence annotate data accordingly.
Context-awareness has been mostly combined with photography as metadata, for example, 
4
 or embedding camera settings for personal reference. Though this is not 
by geo-tagging
uncommon to the project, there are certainly more sensors to be explored and several 
different ways to process data [Section 4.1].
Experiments in image manipulation through sound are presented by Ljungblad et al. [2004], 
where user screaming manages to distort and pixelise a portrait. Similarly, Hakansson et al. 
[2006] use background noise to colorise shadows. While very interesting, this research lacks 
focus and instead the results read like a carte blanche issued along with a multitude of 
cameras and sensors.
3
 For example: OpenGL ES 2.0 was introduced on the iPhone 3GS (June 2009) and the three-axis gyroscope was 
introduced on the iPhone 4 (June 2010).
4
 ?e process of adding location data - usually a place name, or geographical coordinates - to a photograph.
Page 4 of 65Photo tourism is an interesting concept from Snavely et al. [2006], where a series of similar 
photographs - taken roughly at the same location, with different angles - are composited into 
a 3D model of the area. With the use of both image-based modelling (IBM) and rendering 
(IBR), the system creates enough scenery to allow a virtual exploration of the area, after 
minimal user input. IBM and IBR are both outside the scope of this project, but this research 
does lead into the development of Photosynth [Microsoft Corporation, 2012], which is a 
popular mobile app that uses sensor data to guide a user into capturing better-aligned 
photographs for a high-quality panoramic stitch. This app’s concept and design was a direct 
inspiration for the project’s data capture phase [Section 4.2].
Lastly, Lalonde et al. [2010] provide a method for annotating photographs with their 
inferred camera parameters by using the sun position and sky appearance within the image 
as calibration targets. Their work is essentially the reverse of this project and although at 
least one of our goals is similar - collect all relevant data about an outdoor photograph - 
their implementation is much more complicated. It’s a very impressive solution, but more 
than anything it helps highlight the added value and novelty of a context-aware solution.
2.1.2. 3D Graphics Lighting & Shading
Lighting refers to the simulation of light in a virtual environment - where this project 
implements ambient and directional lighting (as well as indirect hemisphere lighting). 
Shading refers to the process of altering the colour of a model based on its position and 
orientation to said lights - where this project implements ambient, diffuse, and specular 
shading. These two concepts are both well-known and largely standardised, so they will not 
be discussed any further for now [Section 5.3]. However, it is important to note that they go 
hand-in-hand, helping deﬁne depth, material characteristics, and the overall atmosphere of a 
scene. Furthermore, it is the lighting that the project is more interested in since shading is 
mostly deﬁned by unique model attributes, whereas lighting constantly changes according 
to the relationship with the environment.
The most accurate and common way to translate a real lighting environment to a virtual one 
5
 (IBL). This technique uses environment mapping to project 
is through image-based lighting
an omni-directional image representing real-world lighting information (gathered from a 
light probe) onto a sphere, used to simulate the lighting in the virtual world. IBL was ﬁrst 
conceived by Paul Debevec in 1998, and he’s since become the ultimate specialist on the 
subject, publishing new work year after year [Debevec, 2012] and specialist tools such as 
HDR Shop [USC Institute for Creative Technologies, 2012]. His results are fascinating and 
incredibly photorealistic, but far too processor-intensive for this project’s device. 
Furthermore, they are founded atop high-dynamic range imaging (HDR) to best understand 
6
 and colour attributes of all light sources within the environment, requiring pre-
the pose
computed diffuse and specular maps from many source images, best suited for large-scale 
7
.
rendering systems rather than the simpliﬁed capabilities of a mobile device
Spherical harmonics lighting is a very similar concept presented by Ramamoorthi and 
Hanrahan [2001], which generally has a better runtime performance (particularly because it 
only handles a diffuse component) but also requires large amounts of prior work in 
calculating lighting coefﬁcients from light probe images
5
 Also known as light-probe mapping when created from photographs of re#ective spheres.

 Position and orientation.

 ?e iPhone is currently capable of capturing HDR images, but this feature has not been released to developers.
Page 5 of 65Another form of IBL is by cube mapping, as explained by Alnasser and Foroosh [2006]. With 
their methodology, they prove that cube mapping is superior to spherical mapping - a 
discovery which goes well with this project’s approach, considering the compatibility of 
OpenGL ES with the former, but not the latter.
An alternative solution for all outdoor lighting is to create a whole physically-based sky/sun 
model [Preetham et al., 1999; Dobashi et al., 2002]. The advantages to this solution include 
full control over the perceived colour of the sky and atmospheric phenomena such as 
scattering and haze. The results of these models are often beautiful images with highly 
realistic sunsets/sunrises and light shafts. However, atmospheric and meteorological data is 
nowhere near accurate enough to be able to simulate the real world for a given place and 
timestamp - which involves a large portion of this project. Furthermore, there would be a lot 
of photometric information lost compared to environment mapping when it comes to 
capturing surrounding reﬂections. This technique is much better suited for modelling a 
whole virtual landscape, rather than compositing. Halawani and Sunar [2010] present a 
similar solution for a virtual sky/sun model, but unfortunately their paper is not written 
very well and proves difﬁcult to understand. Their equations aren’t clearly explained either, 
specially since they have very precise constants whose origin is never clariﬁed. A real shame 
because it’s one of the more recent papers available on the subject.
2.1.3. Automated Compositing
Compositing is the process of combining several visual elements into a single ﬁnished shot. 
Effective compositing of CGI onto a camera view is very complex, since the former is 
rendered and the latter captured under different conditions.
However, every pixel of an image, whether captured or rendered, has a colour and intensity 
associated with it. Therefore, light-matching can be achieved by comparing the values 
between the two images and adjusting them until the right balance is found. The sensor data 
used to set up the virtual environment is a great start, but unlikely to be perfect. 
Compositing is largely an intuitive task with lots of artistic and contextual judgement 
required from the user. An experienced compositor would know how to manually modify 
one or both images to achieve harmony, but this project examines algorithms that can help 
automate this process.
Brightness and contrast adjustments are standard light-matching solutions examined in 
Section 5.6.1, based on greyscale images calculated from luma coefﬁcients. Colour-matching 
is a more complex subject, tackled by Reinhard et al. [2001; 2004] with a statistical approach. 
Their methods are suitable for ofﬂine processing between two 2D images [2001] (as a colour-
transfer algorithm) or real-time processing between rendered and captured video [2004] (as 
a colour-blending algorithm). These methods are also examined in Section 5.6.2  
Karsch et al. [2011] produce some of the most impressive composites as a result of an IBM 
system with minor user input, which are not within the scope of this project. Regardless, 
their work is worth mentioning as the forefront of rendered-to-captured compositing - 
which actually involves reconstructing the photograph as a virtual environment, and then 
inserting the synthetic objects there. Lopez-Moreno et al. [2010] are the close runner-ups to 
foolproof compositing, with their approach involving object-extraction from images in order 
to be used as light-probes based on their silhouettes and surface normals. This is 
conceptually similar to Lalonde et al.’s [2011] method for inferred camera parameters 
[Section 2.1.1], which once again serves to emphasise the added value and novelty of a 
context-aware solution.
Page 6 of 65Currently, there isn’t a fully automated compositing solution yet and there certainly isn’t one 
that can handle all aspects of the job (scale, orientation, position, as well as lighting). 
However, there does seem to be a lot of literature explaining the elements of realistic 
compositing and the instant giveaways of fake images. For example, Lalonde and Efros 
[2007] focus on the importance of colour compatibility within the scene while Kee and Farid 
[2010] pay close attention to discrepancies in light direction instead. Furthermore, it’s always 
helpful to understand the basics and refer to a general overview from both a scientiﬁc 
[Willis, 2007] and artistic [Wright, 2010] point of view.
2.2. Mobile Apps
The scientiﬁc literature survey covers a lot of ground, touching on many extensively-
researched topics with multiple collaborators and many years of previous work behind 
them. However, the comparison to this project can feel inadequate at times considering the 
differences in resources that work as both an advantage (sensor data/capabilities) and 
disadvantage (memory/processing power). Therefore, a more appropriate placement for 
this project may be found amongst similar mobile apps in today’s market. 
2.2.1. Augmented Reality Compositing
CSL Sofas (Fig. 1a) is an interior decoration app for viewing a wide range of sofas in your 
living room. My Wild Night With Ted (Fig. 1b) is a entertainment app for adding the titular 
ﬁlm character to your pictures.
Fig. 1a: CSL Sofas app [Apposing, 2012] Fig. 1b: My Wild Night With Ted 
app[MEDL Mobile, 2012]
Both apps fall within the faux-AR (augmented reality) category since their capabilities 
simply extend to overlaying graphics onto a camera view (or previously captured 
photograph) and they don’t actually gather any information from their environment. 
However, they are true compositing apps, albeit very basic ones. Both apps allow the user to 
scale and move the virtual object, whilst Ted goes a step further and enables a simple 
contrast control. They’re both closed-source, but I strongly suspect they’re rendered with a 
2D graphics engine.
Page 7 of 65Clearly, there is plenty of room for improvement in both cases. Simply offering 3D 
capabilities opens up a whole new set of possible object orientations. While a contrast 
control is an adequate addition, this does not take into account brightness or colour levels 
which are equally, if not more, important. Adding a semi-automated feature to these tools 
would help users with little compositing experience. Finally, if a similar app to CSL Sofas 
existed for exterior or garden decorating (gazebos, benches, fountains, even plants, etc.), 
then the addition of context-aware sunlight would create a much more complete composite.
2.2.2. Ray Tracing
iGPUTrace (Fig. 2a) and Quaternion Julia Raytracer (Fig. 2b) are both graphics-intensive ray 
tracing applications. These apps clearly demonstrate both the rendering capabilities and 
performance limitations of OpenGL ES 2.0 on the iPhone.
Fig. 2a: iGPUTrace app [Angiso?, 2009] Fig. 2b: Quaternion Julia Raytracer app [Angiso?, 
2011]
In reality, rays travels from a light source in all directions, colliding and reﬂecting off objects 
until they reach the viewer. In simulations, the process is the opposite: rays travel from the 
view point to the visible world, calculating the ray paths between an object and a light 
source. Computer graphics applications which use this method are known as ray tracers. Ray 
tracing is the most accurate rendering method in computer graphics, capable of multi-depth 
reﬂection as seen in iGPUTrace and self-reﬂection as seen in Quaternion Julia Raytracer. This 
method is also capable of rendering many other photorealistic effects such as ambient 
occlusion and global illumination, thoroughly covered in specialised literature [Suffern, 
2007] and examined in Section 5.4.
Page 8 of 65However, ray tracing carries very expensive render times. iGPUTrace performs in real-time, 
which is a very impressive feat, but once more complex models are introduced, such as 
those in the Quaternion Julia Raytracer, the real-time rendering element is lost. Fig. 2b actually 
shows the app mid-render. Therefore, we can expect real-time ray tracing in the future, but 
for now this project must utilise alternative rendering techniques.
2.3. Non-Commercial Technology
Finally, I present a brief glimpse into the latest previsualisation work for ﬁlm and 
augmented reality for broadcast television. This is the absolute forefront of technology in 
context-awareness, computer graphics, compositing, and any other areas covered in this 
section. These are the technologies attached to multi-million pound productions, re-shaping 
the industry.
2.3.1. Previsualisation in Film
Simulcam for Avatar (Fig. 3a) by Digital Domain Productions, Inc. [2012] and Zviz for Rango 
(Fig. 3b) by Industrial Light & Magic [2012] are magniﬁcent previsualisation tools that adapt 
motion-capture technology to a camera. These devices move inside a physical space rigged 
with location sensors, thereby placing the camera inside a virtual environment. The device 
renders this view in real-time, and anything on set that has a CGI counterpart is rendered in 
the view as well. This allows a director to see his live-action actors as the virtual characters 
they are playing, thus being able to guide the action with instant feedback as opposed to 
waiting until post-production to see the ﬁnal results (or using an incredible amount of 
imagination). In Avatar, for example, this allows the ﬁlmmakers to see the Na’vi in Pandora 
rather than just the actors playing the Na’vi on a set meant to be Pandora.
Fig. 3a: Simulcam on the set of Avatar [Digital Domain Fig. 3b: Zviz on the set of Rango [Industrial Light & 
Productions, Inc., 2010] Magic, 2011]
Though clearly not within the same technology (or budget) league, this project does have a 
very similar goal to these previsualisation cameras: the ability to combine real and virtual 
elements into a uniﬁed preview-quality shot, in real-time. Their approach inserts real 
elements into a virtual world; my approach inserts virtual elements into the real world, 
more similar to...
Page 9 of 652.3.2. Augmented Reality in Broadcast Television
The BBC’s Match of the Day programme has a very intricate setup for AR rendering, with a 
system combining technologies from Vizrt [2012], Deltatre [2012], MotionAnalysis [2012b], and 
their own in-house graphics department. Unlike the previsualisation cameras for ﬁlm, which 
aid the ﬁlmmakers, the beneﬁts here are directed towards the viewer for a richer television 
experience. The graphics are very light-neutral and not intended for a realistic composite, 
they’re simply meant to add a “fresh appeal” to the show. The technical focus of this system 
instead lies within real-time motion-tracking, which is outside the scope of this project. Fig. 4 
shows two screen caps from a recent broadcast of the programme, highlighting the CamTrak 
technology.

3.1. iOS SDK
iOS is the operating system that runs on 
the Apple iPhone 4. It manages the device 
hardware and provides the technologies 
required to implement native apps. The 
iOS SDK contains the tools and interfaces 
needed to develop, install, run, and test 
these apps. Apps communicate with the 
hardware through well-deﬁned system 
interfaces that can be viewed as a set of 
layers (Fig. 5). Higher-level frameworks 
can be found towards the top of the stack, 
Fig. 5: Layers of iOS [Apple Inc., 2012a]
with lower-level frameworks towards the 
bottom.
3.1.1. Cocoa Touch Layer
The Cocoa Touch layer contains the key frameworks for building iOS applications. In this 
layer the project sets up the majority of the user interface (UI) and navigation controls using 
UIKit and Storyboards. These are both high-level interfaces that handle the application 
layout, view controller hierarchy, and user input. They make connections between UI 
elements (sliders, buttons, views, etc.) and code snippets, which are then used for further 
processing.
3.1.2. Media Layer
The Media layer contains graphics, audio, and video technologies.
3.1.2.1. Camera
There is a basic camera class found within 
UIKit: UIImagePickerController. This type of 
camera controller is used in both AR 
compositing apps mentioned in Section 
2.2.1, which simply overlay graphics onto a 
camera view or previously captured 
photograph. This project requires ﬁner 
control over the camera, which is handled 
in a lower-level layer with a setup cost of 
four frameworks instead of one: 
AVFoundation, CoreImage, CoreMedia, and 
CoreVideo.
Fig. 6: Camera view resolutions
The key design issue here is video 
resolution. The camera quality level must 
conform to one of many presets available, ranging from 192x144 pixels to 1280x720 pixels. 
This project aims for preview-quality composites rendered in real-time, so there needs to be 
Page 11 of 65a balance between quality and performance. With this in mind, the application uses a 
medium preset of 480x360, which is a quarter of the screen resolution (960x640) with 20 
pixels of vertical cropping on the top and bottom of the view (Fig. 6). This is an adequate 
choice given the screen resolution of the previous iPhone (3GS, 480x320) and that neither the 
aims or objectives of the project are compromised as a result.
3.1.2.2. 2D Graphics
CoreGraphics handles native 2D image-based rendering. This framework is used to aid basic 
processing and analysis of cube map faces and textures.
3.1.2.3. 3D Graphics
The OpenGLES and GLKit frameworks 
combine to handle 3D graphics rendering 
on OpenGL ES 2.0. Fig. 7 depicts the 
OpenGL ES client-server model on iOS, 
where the application calls OpenGL ES 
functions via an OpenGL ES client. The 
client processes the function call and 
converts it into commands delivered to the 
OpenGL server. There are plenty of built-in 
function calls to the OpenGL ES API - 
which mostly constitute boilerplate code - 
so instead of a full listing of these

functions, Fig. 8 describes the pseudo-code

for the OpenGL ES setup within the 
application (iOS properties are italicised).

3.1.3. Core Services Layer
The Core Services layer contains fundamental system services. It includes the Foundation 
framework which deﬁnes a base of Objective-C classes providing a set of useful primitives.
Page 12 of 653.1.3.1. Compass
The digital compass is part of the CoreLocation framework, providing heading information to 
the application. It’s very easy to set up and includes its own manager to handle event 
updates. The key design decision here is accuracy. Like the camera, the compass needs to 
ﬁnd a balance between composite quality and real-time performance. The compass 
calculates the viewer orientation (azimuth angle) relative to the sun and the virtual 
environment [Sections 5.3.3, 5.3.4, and 5.5.2], but is a huge drain on resources. Therefore, the 
compass uses magnetic heading updates (as opposed to true heading updates, which are 
GPS-assisted) with a one-degree ﬁlter.
3.1.3.2. GPS
The GPS is also part of the CoreLocation framework, providing location information to the 
application. Like the gyroscope, it is very easy to set up and includes it own manager to 
handle event updates. The key design decision here is, once again, accuracy. As we will see 
in Section 4.1, accurate physical motion tracking (translation in 3D space) via sensors is not 
yet within the reach of mobile devices and hence only used in the application to calculate the 
device position relative to the sun. The accuracy presets range from navigation-performance 
to three kilometres; this application uses the 10 metre preset (which includes changes in 
altitude).
3.1.3.3. Gyroscope
The gyroscope is part of the CoreMotion framework, providing motion-based data from the 
device. Unlike the location services, it requires a self-declared manager to handle event 
updates.  For this, I have chosen to deploy a timer ﬁring every 0.1 seconds. It’s quite a drain 
on resources but a focal point of the application, driving the same data as the compass (as 
the zenith angle) as well as the hemisphere shading [Section 5.4].
3.2. OpenGL ES
OpenGL ES is a subset of the desktop OpenGL API for rendering graphics on embedded 
systems, creating a powerful low-level interface between software and graphics acceleration. 
OpenGL ES 1.1 uses a ﬁxed function pipeline (Fig. 9a) which is easier to handle, but has 
many restrictions. OpenGL ES 2.0 uses a programmable pipeline (Fig. 9b) which leverages 
the power of shaders.
Fig. 9a: Open GL ES 1.1 "xed function pipeline Fig. 9b: Open GL ES 2.0 programmable pipeline 
[Khronos Group, 2012] [Khronos Group, 2012]
Page 13 of 65Shaders are code that run on the GPU, written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language). They 
do not compile within the Xcode IDE, instead they are delivered as strings to the OpenGL ES 
server and compile at runtime, on the iPhone itself. They add so much power and ﬂexibility 
to the OpenGL ES 2.0 pipeline and are capable of rendering procedural textures, particle 
effects, complex materials, and so much more that isn’t possible in OpenGL ES 1.1. However, 
a challenging limitation is that their individual vertex or fragment output data can’t be read 
directly, instead the full render is drawn straight onto the frame buffer. This is both a 
development and analysis obstacle, but still the overall beneﬁts of shaders far outweigh this 
hindrance.
3.2.1. Vertex Shader
The vertex shader handles per-vertex data such as vertices, normals, and texture 
coordinates. It can perform complex calculations and pass multiple user-deﬁned parameters 
to the fragment shader, but must always output a vertex position through the gl_Position 
variable to the next stage of the pipeline. For a complete implementation of this project’s 
vertex shader, see Appendix D.
3.2.2. Fragment Shader
The fragment shader handles per-pixel data such as material characteristics, light intensity, 
and texture colour. It can receive multiple user-deﬁned parameters from the vertex shader 
and perform many complex calculations, but its one goal is to output the ﬁnal colour of a 
pixel and pass it through to the next stage of the pipeline via the gl_FragColor variable. For a 
complete implementation of this project’s fragment shader, see Appendix E.
3.2.3. Per-Vertex vs. Per-Pixel Shading
Generally speaking, there are less vertices in a scene than there are pixels, making it 
advisable to carry out complex calculations in the vertex shader rather than in the fragment 
shader. In fact, fragment shaders even require precision qualiﬁers for variables to ensure 
better code optimisation. For some models, performing the shading calculations at the 
vertex level can result in a loss of detail and quality due to inaccurate interpolation. Shifting 
this work to the fragment shader for per-pixel shading is the solution to this problem, but 
can be detrimental to performance.
If we consider the largest model of this project - the Dragon with 50,000 vertices [Appendix 
C]- and the screen at full display - 960x640 equalling 614,400 pixels - then indeed the vertices 
< pixels rule holds true. However, most of the OpenGL ES canvas is rendered transparent, 
with the model taking up approximately 10-20% of the screen, or roughly 100,000 pixels. 
This is a much more manageable number for the fragment shader. The application carries 
out most shading calculations in the fragment shader, but the vertex shader is used for 
indirect views of the environment (such as those produced by reﬂections and refractions) 
which are distorted anyway and don’t need to be as detailed as a model texture.
Page 14 of 654. Data Capture
4.1. Sensor Analysis
A compositing tool is primarily concerned with visual data, in this case using captured 
photographs and rendered models to produce a ﬁnal image. Secondary data from the device 
sensors can form a bridge between these two separate entities by creating a common 
environment. Geometric data is needed to inform the position of virtual elements according 
8
:
to their real counterparts. This type of data can be gathered from the following sensors
• Accelerometer
• Compass
• GPS
• Gyroscope
For these motion sensors, Benford et al. [2003] describe a framework for analysing the 
movement of physical interfaces in terms of sensibility, sensability, and desirability. Sensible 
movements are those that users naturally perform; sensable movements are those that can 
be measured by a computer; and desirable movements are those that are required by a given 
application. In this data capture phase, the user’s physical movements include:
1) Be outdoors
2) Choose a camera position
3) Choose a camera orientation
This simple list of activities can be analysed against the motion framework to determine 
9

which sensors are most suitable for implementation (Fig. 10)

All listed movements are desirable as they will determine the geometric structure of the 
virtual environment for the light [Sections 5.3.3 and 5.4], camera [Section 5.3.4] and cube 
map [Section 5.5.2]. They are also completely sensible as they are naturally occurring, 
unrestricted movements - the device can move and rotate anywhere in 3D space, while the 
user can travel anywhere in the world.
8
 ?e camera could also be used to track movement by implementing select motion-capture or augmented reality 
tracking techniques. ?is is beyond the scope of this project, which is exclusively based on pure motion sensors.
9
 It’s worth noting that there are other ways to obtain geolocation (e.g. WiFi, cellular towers). However, these are 
less accurate than GPS and this system has the inherent advantage of outdoor use where GPS signal is usually 
much stronger and more reliable. Hence, the reason why the alternatives have been largely ignored.
Page 15 of 65Geolocation is sensable by GPS to an accuracy of approximately ±10 metres horizontally and 
±15 metres vertically [Coast Guard Navigation Service, 2011]. This is an acceptable margin of 
error, as the properties of sunlight are highly unlikely to change within a few metres. 
Furthermore, this conforms to the chosen sensor accuracy preset [Section 3.1.3.2].
The camera, however, will move about the user in much smaller distances trying to set up 
the desired shot, resulting in a positional shift that will not be picked up by the GPS. This 
affects the virtual camera’s position as would a zoom or pan about the scene. Accelerometers 
are much more responsive to smaller movements, detecting changes in acceleration 
(speciﬁcally, g-force). This data can then be converted into positional movement using Eq. 1:
a= Accelerometer?Gravity

The double integral may be straight-forward, but the real problem lies with the readings as 
even the slightest sensor error will grow exponentially and deem the whole calculation 
useless. The iPhone (and most mobile devices) have very noisy accelerometers that require a 
lot of calibration and ﬁltering. Therefore, calculating movement accurately in 3D space is 
impossible in practice (for now). Seifert and Camacho [2007] provide a detailed explanation 
and optimistic implementation; however, this project will have to classify the movement as 
not sensable.

Finally, the camera orientation can be calculated from the device’s compass

11
, 
with as there are a ﬁnite number of angles per rotation axis (0<x<360 and -90<x<90
respectively). These values can be comfortably replicated by a virtual camera as they total 
two axes, each with an origin reference (magnetic north and device orientation, 
respectively). 
4.2. Environment Capture
Due to the native support for cube maps in OpenGL ES, the environment will be captured as 
six faces, with the front face annotated with geometric reference data applicable to the rest of 
the cube map. Fig. 11 shows the user interface for this application phase.
10
 A GPS-assisted compass gives more accurate readings with a true heading, as opposed to a magnetic heading, 
but in practice the di?erence between them is never more than three degrees and it is best to conserve resources 
(and real-time performance) with the less processor-intensive option.
11
 In reality, the gyroscope roll data lies between 0<x<180 but the -90<x<90 scale is more user-friendly as it 
places 0 at the front-facing landscape orientation.

UI contains a capture frame with these dimensions, centred in the screen, for the beneﬁt of 
the user. The portion of the camera view that lies within this frame at the time of capture 
will be used as a cube map face. Meanwhile, the device orientation sensors (compass and 
gyroscope) are running in the background and serve to annotate the ﬁnal cube map with a 
geometric reference point. 
Fig. 12a describes the pseudo-code for the unassisted environment capture phase of the 
application. In addition, each picture phase includes a small amount of custom image 
editing which crops the camera view (480x360) to the capture frame (256x256) and rotates 
the output by 180 degrees (cube map faces are passed into OpenGL ES with an upside-down 
orientation). These steps are omitted from the pseudo-code for clarity and brevity. 
Furthermore, it’s worth noting that the user is guided through the capture phase by 
displaying the name of the next face to be captured on-screen.

This process uses both orientation sensors continuously, but still only annotates the cube 
map with a heading reference. This is because the user is forced to keep the horizontal faces 
within a reasonable roll range centred about 0 (front-facing landscape orientation) since the 
compass becomes unresponsive and error-prone at upward-facing (zenith angle 90) and 
downward-facing (zenith angle -90) orientations. Furthermore, thanks to gravity, up will 
always be up and down will always be down for all objects/environments. The azimuth 
orientation is what really matters since the user’s position deﬁnes which way is front, right, 
back, and left.
Page 18 of 655. Model Rendering & Compositing
This section covers the main algorithms implemented by this project’s previsualisation tool, 
speciﬁcally relating to rendering/compositing. Compositing occurs at the render stage, on 
the target (synthetic object), in real-time, by leveraging the OpenGL ES 2.0 capability of 
 and 
accessing the vertex and fragment shaders directly. There is no post-processing involved
the synthetic objects are continuously drawn straight from the shaders onto the screen, on 
top of a live video camera view. The bulk of these algorithms can be found within the code 
listings for the vertex and fragment shaders [Appendices D and E]. Their resulting images, 
further discussion, and analysis can be found in Section 7.
5.1. Colour Priors
In some cases, the following algorithms require visual environment/model data (such as 
mean and standard deviation values) gathered prior to rendering by a custom image 
analysis interface; I have dubbed these elements colour priors. 
5.1.1. Model Textures
For the environment (the source image), the colour priors are calculated from the cube map 
faces. For the model (the target image), the colour priors are calculated from an edited “green 
screen” version of the UV texture (Figs. 13a-c). This edited texture is necessary for accurate 
results, as it is very rare for a UV texture map to cover the whole model texture [Appendix 
C]. In the case of the banana texture, the yellow background and black blotches would skew

original texture is still used for the main rendering as some models may pick up a green

 RGB value (0, 255, 0). Interestingly, the RGB colour system justi"es the inclusion of a green channel because 
the human eye is most sensitive to green light. Green screens are designed this way because (1) most computers/
cameras can pick up a pure green colour easily thanks to the RGB system, and (2) it is a very uncommon colour, 
unlikely to be found on real or rendered imagery.
Page 19 of 655.1.2. Greyscale Priors
Some algorithms only use intensity priors, requiring a conversion from three-channel RGB 
to single-channel greyscale. There are many greyscale conversion techniques, each serving a 
different purpose [Helland, 2012], but the one used throughout the implementation is the

5.2. Geometry in OpenGL ES
16
At its most basic level, geometry in OpenGL ES requires two 4x4 matrices: the projection 
matrix and the model-view matrix. 
5.2.1. Projection Matrix
The projection matrix deﬁnes a perspective view for the virtual camera. For a more accurate 
AR experience, this matrix draws its parameter values from the physical camera’s technical 
speciﬁcations: ﬁeld of view = 61.048, aspect ratio = 1.5 [Caramba App Development, 2012; 
Lumo, F., 2010]. All models are processed with Behrens’ obj2opengl script [2012] and 
therefore have normalised vertices, so the near and far clipping planes of the projection 
17
 and 1.1, respectively.
matrix are set to 0.1
5.2.2. Model-View Matrix
The model-view matrix is a combination of a model matrix and a view matrix. This is only 
relevant to explain the name, as later on we’ll see that the actual view is controlled in 
different ways depending on the task at hand. Effectively, the model-view matrix transforms 
the environment into object-space, centred about the model. In terms of the application, the 
model-view matrix handles standard object transformations (translate, rotate, scale) 
controlled by the user.
15
 Similar to the green-screen and RGB colour theory, luma is also designed to accommodate the human eye’s 
increased sensitivity to green light (followed by red, then blue light).
16
 ?ere is a practical reason for 4x4 matrices in 3D space, in terms of handling homogeneous coordinates, 
quaternions, the concept of in"nity, etc. ?is is a very deep and complex mathematical subject, but the resulting 
model-view-projection matrix system in OpenGL ES literature is largely presented as standard practice without 
further discussion. Bom"n [2011] delivers a detailed guide covering the fundamentals of this area, based on 
work by Baker [2012] and Lengyel [2004]. Buck [2012] also provides a very solid coverage of the topic.
17
 Negative values are invalid and really small values close to zero may cause z-!ghting. 
Page 20 of 655.3. Lighting & Shading
5.3.1. Lighting Model
Both real and simulated light are separated into two categories: direct and indirect 
18
illumination . Direct illumination is light that hits a surface by travelling directly from a 
light source. Indirect illumination is light that hits a surface after being reﬂected off another 
object.  A combination of both is needed to replicate natural illumination.
5.3.1.1. Ambient Light (Daylight)
Daytime refers to the time of day between sunrise and sunset, where a given point on the 
planet’s surface experiences natural illumination as a cause of daylight. This includes direct  
19
 
illumination from sunlight, as well as indirect illumination caused by diffuse sky radiation
and all reﬂections off outdoor surfaces. Thus, no objects are completely obscured during 
daytime, and the way to simulate this in a virtual environment is through ambient light.
Ambient light performs a constant illumination throughout the scene, emitted uniformly in 
20
.
all directions, with a constant magnitude
In this implementation, daylight only has an intensity value, l , as it is very difﬁcult to 
d
calculate a suitable colour, affected by many uncontrollable factors such as weather and 
pollution. This, however, can be compensated for with colour-correction algorithms [Section 
5.6]. Daylight intensity is a decision left to the user, as image-processing techniques would 
need more information (such as ground truth images) to distinguish between the natural 
colour of objects and their perceived colour given the current lighting conditions.
5.3.1.2 Directional Light (Sunlight)
Sunlight is simulated by directional light, in which all emitted rays are parallel to each other. 
They originate from a single point and travel in a single direction. Furthermore, their 
incidence radiance is not affected by the position of the light source along the ray’s direction 
of travel (no decay). Essentially, this means that directional light simulates a light source that

5.3.2. Shading Model
The implementation adopts a modiﬁed version of the Blinn-Phong shading model [Blinn, 
1977] for its simplicity, effectiveness, and ability to accommodate a mobile light source and 
23
viewer . The surface attributes that ﬁt this model include an ambient, diffuse, and specular 
18
 Also referred to as local and global illumination, respectively.
19
 As a side note, this phenomenon explains the perceived colour of the sky, which is blue due to the fact that the 
atmosphere scatters blue light more e?ectively than any other colour.
20
 ?is is known as a 3D isotropic radiance "eld.
21
 ?e mathematical theory behind directional light comes from the Dirac delta function: a generalised function  
that is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it is in"nite.
22
 Technically, the intensity associated with both lights is a colour ranging from pure black (intensity = 0.0) to 
pure white (intensity = 1.0).
23
 In fact, this is the default shading model used in the "xed function OpenGL ES 1.1 pipeline.

device and updated as needed. Surface rotation (azimuth) and slope (zenith) angles could be 
gathered from the compass and gyroscope respectively, but the SPA doesn’t seem to take 
these values into account for the ﬁnal output. Instead, these values are used for matrix 
transformations covered further in this section.

The SPA outputs a zenith angle, ", and azimuth angle, #, for the position of the sun in the 
sky. This data conforms to a horizontal coordinate system for celestial bodies, which needs 
to be converted to 3D cartesian coordinates for use in the OpenGL ES environment. This 
conversion is done via the spherical coordinate system. Figs. 16a-c depict diagrams for each 
coordinate system and Eq. 5 outlines the mathematical conversion.

Furthermore, there are two practical modiﬁcations to this process:
1) r is negligible because the sun is simulated by an inﬁnitely far directional light
2) z is inverted because in OpenGL ES negative values go “into” the screen
Finally, the sun position relative to the device orientation is calculated with a matrix driven 
by sensor data. This matrix is rotated about the x-axis by the gyroscope roll angle and 
rotated about the y-axis by the compass heading angle. The resultant matrix is then 
multiplied by the initial sun position vector (x, y, z), giving the ﬁnal sun position vector
5.3.4. Camera Position
The camera position, E, is calculated in a similar way to the ﬁnal step of the sun position 
algorithm. The shading model assumes an inﬁnitely far viewer, much like a directional light, 
since the device can’t actually detect the user’s view pose relative to the screen. Therefore, 
the initial camera position vector is (1, 1, 1) - this is for effective vector-matrix multiplications 
rather than representing a default position (it’s more like an “identity vector”). The 
orientation identity matrix is rotated about the x-axis by the gyroscope roll angle and rotated 
about the y-axis by the compass heading angle. The resultant matrix is then multiplied by 
the initial camera position vector, giving the ﬁnal camera position vector.
5.4. Hemisphere Shading
Hemisphere shading is a term I coined to describe the combination of hemisphere lighting and 
hemisphere occlusion in a context-aware rendering environment.
5.4.1. Hemisphere Lighting
Hemisphere lighting is an indirect illumination algorithm simulating the effect of daylight, 
based on two hemispheres. An object in a scene is prone to global illumination effects from 
Page 24 of 6528
its surroundings , for which hemisphere 
lighting isolates a sky plane directly above 
the object and a ground plane directly 
below it. These planes are also referred to 
as the upper and lower hemisphere, 
respectively. In hemisphere lighting, a 
surface location with a normal pointing 
straight up receives all of its illumination 
from the upper hemisphere. Consequently, 
a surface location with a normal pointing 
straight down receives all of its 
illumination from the lower hemisphere. 
Surface points in between these two 
extremes receive their illumination from a 
combination of both, depending on the 
angle of the normal.  Fig. 17 depicts a 
sphere illuminated by hemisphere lighting

The original algorithm [Rost and Licea-Kane, 2009] simply takes " as the surface normal 
angle calculated from a pre-determined light position vector. However, this implementation 
leverages the advantage of a mobile camera to deﬁne " based on the camera’s view of the

. The hemisphere lighting model 
surface normal, given a certain gyroscope roll value
operates within the range 0<"<180, so gyroscope data is adjusted accordingly from 
-90<"<90. It’s then passed as a 3D vector to compute the dot product with the surface 
normal.
The colour of the hemispheres is decided by colour priors calculated from the environment, 
, is extracted from the mean RGB 
for an effective composite. The upper hemisphere colour, c
u
, is extracted from the mean 
value of the top cube map face. The lower hemisphere colour, c
l
RGB value of the bottom cube map face.
5.4.2. Hemisphere Occlusion
Ambient occlusion is a ray-tracing technique for rendering photo-realistic surface shadows. 
Ambient light on its own simply illuminates objects with a ﬂat, constant colour, creating a 
dangerous compositing territory in the absence of sunlight on a cloudy day. Ambient 
occlusion addresses this situation by performing self-shading of objects based on their own 
28
 In close-quarters, many other objects would a?ect the colour of the model, but in wide open areas (such as a 
"eld) the e?ects of hemisphere lighting are more apparent.
29
 Both N and E are normalised (length is 1), so cos? can be taken straight from the dot product of the two 
r
vectors.
Page 25 of 65(and surrounding) geometry. The basic idea of ambient occlusion is to determine the amount 
of ambient light received by a surface point. For each point, this amount depends on how 
much of the upper hemisphere is visible and how much is blocked (occluded) by 
surrounding geometry [Suffern, 2007]. This is why true ambient occlusion is only possible 
with ray-tracing, as each object vertex must perform ray-casting to determine its occlusion 
30
. Like the diffuse and specular components previously covered, this occlusion factor 
factor
is then multiplied by the model’s ambient colour to determine the ﬁnal ambient appearance.
Hemisphere lighting can be used to simulate a crude version of ambient occlusion good 
enough for use in previsualisation compositing [Section 7.2.2], as long as appropriate values 
are chosen. Once again, this is decided by colour priors calculated from the environment. 
Ambient occlusion is a shadowing algorithm, and therefore uses greyscale values. It would 
be inadequate to use data from the top and bottom cube map faces because, theoretically, 
they are both ﬂat planes which are not susceptible to environment shadowing effects: 
looking up means looking directly at the light source, while looking down means looking at 
a perfectly illuminated surface. Given that natural illumination always occurs from top to 
bottom - never from the ground-up - then it’s more appropriate to examine its effect on 
objects within the horizontal planes: front, back, left, and right cube map faces. These images 
show objects in light and in shadow, and thus are a better gauge of the intensity information

5.5. Environment Mapping
Environment mapping is a form of image-based lighting which captures the scene 
surrounding an object as one or more texture maps. These specialised textures are usually 
viewed indirectly through accurate reﬂections or refractions on the object surface, computed 
at render time.
5.5.1. Reﬂections & Refractions
Reﬂections and refractions are standard mathematical procedures built into OpenGL ES (Fig. 
18), but brieﬂy examined here for cohesiveness:
Function Description
reﬂect(I, N) For the incident vector I and surface normal N, returns the 
reﬂection direction.
refract(I, N, eta) For the incident vector I, surface normal N, and the refractive 
index eta, returns the refraction direction.

For both functions, the incident vector I is a vertex of the object and the surface normal N is 
the corresponding normal (both are 3D vectors in object-space). Instead of transforming 
these into viewer-space with the usual normal matrix, as per the shading model, they are 
transformed post-reﬂection/refraction with an environment matrix. This is because the 
30
 Also referred to as visibility or accessibility factor.
Page 26 of 65surface reﬂections/refractions “stick” to the model and are dependent on the orientation of 
the device. The environment matrix for reﬂections is simply the normal matrix rotated about 
the x-axis by the gyroscope roll angle and rotated about the y-axis by the compass heading 
angle. The environment matrix for refractions is calculated in the same way, but with 
negative-value angles (a transparent material sees through to the opposite cube map face).
Transparent, refractive materials conform to a reduced version of the Blinn-Phong shading 
model, described by Eq. 7.

very basic simulation of refraction as more accurate techniques require ray-tracing. 
However, it’s adequate enough for simulating further techniques.
5.5.2. Cube Map
Environment mapping is traditionally accomplished with either spherical or cube 
32
. Both methods are supported by desktop OpenGL but OpenGL ES only uses cube 
mapping
mapping which is thankfully the method best suited to the implementation, from the 
capture phase up until the ﬁnal render. 
A cube map is a specialised texture constructed from six individual 2D textures, organised to 
represent the faces of a cube: Left (-X), Right (+X), Down (-Y), Up (+Y), Back (-Z), Front (+Z). 
With each face deﬁned by a sign and an axis, a 3D space is created. Within this space, a 3D 
texture coordinate used as a direction vector can decide which face(s) it’s looking at, and 
33
 value intersecting the cube map, thus computing an accurate colour for the 
return a texel
reﬂection/refraction algorithms. The built-in GLSL function textureCube(sampler, coord) 
handles the lookup. 
In AR compositing, cube maps are most suitable for rendering reﬂections because they 
produce an indirect view of elements outside the camera view - there is no direct 
34
. In some cases, cube maps produce even 
comparison to what isn’t part of the visible scene
better results because the camera/photographer is not rendered by the reﬂections (since they 
weren’t captured for the cube map). Refractions, on the other hand, can be an instant 
giveaway of a bad composite because the transparent object creates the illusion of seeing

 ?ese properties are particularly helpful in reducing calculations for the processor-intensive live feed 
procedure.

 ?is is mostly true, as the model does pick up re#ections from nearby objects.
Page 27 of 65right through it to the AR camera view of the scene (with the proper distortion, of course). A 
cube map misaligned with the current video frame or a change in scenery (e.g., a person 
walking behind the object, not captured by the original cube map) will produce an  
obviously inaccurate composite, which brings us to the next section...
5.5.3. Live Feed
Transparent objects blend right through to the underlaying camera view, creating a 
challenging AR compositing problem as outlined above. This is solved with continuous re-
texturing from a live camera feed, which deﬁnitely straddles the boundary of real-time 
rendering, massively increasing the system load. There isn’t a particularly complex 
35
, but special care must be taken towards efﬁcient data 
algorithm for this procedure
management and optimised code execution. Leveraging the power of the self.pause function 
in GLKit for pausing and resuming OpenGL ES rendering (exclusive to iOS 5), Fig. 19 
describes the pseudo-code for processing refractions from a live camera feed.

end PROCESS
Fig. 19: Pseudo-code for Live Refractions
The critical component of this process lies within lines 5-8, between the rendering cycle 
pause and resume commands. Retrieving the camera image (5) is a smooth procedure since 
the raw camera output has already been converted to the native UIImage format for the AR 
display. Cropping the image (6) to conform to texture speciﬁcations (square, power-of-two 
dimensions) involves quick and easy image-editing code, still operating at a relatively high 
level within the iOS hierarchy (Media layer). Converting the image to the PNG format (7) is 
the most expensive procedure, incurring a costly read and write cycle since OpenGL ES will 
not accept the native UIImage format. This step requires the use of lower-level frameworks 
from the Core Services layer. Finally, the image is assigned to an OpenGL ES texture node (8) 
with standard texture-loading code.
This process can also be used for rendering live reﬂections, using the front-facing device 
camera. This is simply an experimental feature since, from a compositing point-of-view, it 
doesn’t make sense to render live reﬂections at the cost of losing the back-facing camera. 
35
 Just the simple task of reducing a texture coordinate from 3D to 2D.
Page 28 of 65This means that the whole display would act as a mirror, rather than a lens, with the 
synthetic object on top. It may be possible to use both cameras in the future, but not for now.
5.6. Colour Correction
Finally, colour correction algorithms take charge of the more traditional aspects of 
compositing: comparing a source and target image, then adjusting the colour values of the 
latter to match the former.
5.6.1. Intensity Adjustments
Brightness and contrast algorithms are image interpolation procedures that adjust the 
intensity of a pixel, based on a target image. These algorithms were ﬁrst devised by Haeberli 
and Voorhies [1994] but are now considered standard image manipulation techniques for 2D 
[Brinkmann, 2008] and 3D [Rost and Licea-Kane, 2009] graphics. The general form of these

The source images are usually a uniform shade of grey, which we can extract from greyscale 
colour priors calculated from the environment’s horizontal planes (front, back, left, and right 
cube map faces). The ﬁrst task for these priors is to ﬁt the luma-converted target pixel 
between the lowest-value and highest-value priors using the built-in OpenGL ES smoothstep 
37
. This ensures that the rendered model is never darker or lighter than the 
function
environment (much like the hemisphere occlusion algorithm values [Section 5.4.2]).
5.6.1.1. Brightness
Brightness is a simple scaling operation, multiplying each fragment shader pixel by an 
intensity factor between two speciﬁc bounds. Like the smoothstep clamping process, these 
bounds are deﬁned by the darkest and lightest priors from the environment’s horizontal 
planes. The ﬂoating-point intensity value of the current luma-converted target pixel is then 
used as the interpolation coefﬁcient for performing a linear blend between these two priors. 
The result is the intensity factor for adjusting the brightness of the same target pixel. Eq. 9 
outlines this process.

Page 29 of 655.6.1.2. Contrast
Contrast is a step further from brightness, adjusting the relationship between the higher and 
lower intensities of an image. High contrast increases the differences in the intensity range, 
whereas low contrast reduces them. A simple contrast operator will likely use a grey mid-
 0.5) to compute the contrast curve, making everything above this 
tone value (intensity ≈
point lighter and everything below it darker. This curve point is adequate for images with 
fairly even intensity distributions, but this may not always be the case (e.g. sunny scenes are 
much brighter than overcast scenes). Biased contrast operators have an adjustable curve 
point, usually selected manually by the user [Brinkmann, 2008]. This implementation 
deﬁnes this value automatically, extracted from the mean greyscale prior of the 
environment’s horizontal planes. Eqs. 10a and 10b outline the contrast adjustment procedure

5.6.2. Colour Matching
The colour matching method in this section is based on an ofﬂine colour transfer algorithm 
for images [Reinhard et al., 2001] and a real-time colour blending algorithm for video 
[Reinhard et al., 2004] with similar foundations. The results of these algorithms are 
respectively reproduced in Fig. 20 and Fig. 21 to help distinguish the two in the subsequent 
analysis.

Both algorithms adjust a target (model) from source (environment) data. They perform the 
compositing in post-processing once all imagery has been rendered or captured and there is 
a full set of data available.

 colour space [Ruderman et al., 
The colour-transfer algorithm manipulates data in the L%&
1998; cited in Reinhard et al, 2001], while the colour-blending algorithm manipulates data in 
39
 colour space [Wyszecki and Stiles, 1982; cited in Reinhard et al, 
a version of the CIELAB
2004]. The key difference is that CIELAB is preferred as an optimised version of L$% which 
omits a superﬂuous conversion to logarithmic space, in order to fast-process data.  
The 2004 solution includes two user parameters, simply referred to as s and d, for adjusting 
the intensity of the blending effect. A strange observation made in their own paper is that 
parameter d “did not appreciably change the result” [p.6] and may be removed from the 
calculations. It’s odd that it’s still included in the ﬁnal version of their algorithm, but an even 
more curious fact is that omitting d effectively excludes the source mean and leaves only the 
following data to perform the compositing: target value, target mean, target variance, and 
source variance. The 2001 solution doesn’t have any user parameters but does have a very 
robust model, using the following data to perform the compositing: target value, target 
mean, target standard deviation, source mean, and source standard deviation.
This project implements a combination of the two algorithms, adopting: 
40
; and,
1) The CIELAB colour space approximation from Reinhard et al. [2004] (Eq. 11a)
2) The mathematical process from Reinhard et al. [2001] (Eq. 11b)

Page 34 of 657. Testing & Results
The testing of the system was carried out by isolating the main algorithms into separate 
applications, in order to clearly appreciate key elements and individual effects. For the same 
reason, most results are rendered against a black background or pre-loaded environment as 
the underlaying camera view would be too inconsistent and distracting.
The ﬁnal implementation combines all the algorithms into a single application which still 
performs in real-time, for which fully composited renderings are presented at the very end 
of this section.
, be it manual or automatic, in any of these images.
There is no post-processing involved
7.1. Sunlight
This section examines the basic lighting and shading algorithm only, with particular 
emphasis on the SPA output when calculated and transformed with real device data (ﬁnal 
sun position).
Test Parameters:
Ambient: 0.50; Diffuse: 0.50; Specular: 0.50; Gloss: 1.0; Daylight: 0.50; Sunlight; 0.50

-0.9) 
The shading model performs as expected, albeit with slightly rough interpolation between 
the ambient, diffuse, and specular components. This is most apparent on the Test Sphere 
model, particularly Figs. 24c and 24d, but unnoticeable on the Chapel model. The more 
computationally-expensive Phong shading algorithm could be used instead of the optimised 
Blinn-Phong solution (which uses Gouraud shading), thus increasing the smoothness of the 
shading interpolation [Phong, 1975]. However, the difference is likely to go unnoticed on 
more expressive, textured models than the simple test sphere.
Page 35 of 65The SPA and matrix transformations are highly responsive to device data, resulting in an 
instant and accurate calculation of the virtual directional light’s position with regards to the 
real sun (not pictured).
7.2. Hemisphere Shading
The hemisphere shading algorithms simulate crude approximations of more advanced ray 
tracing techniques which can’t perform in real-time on commercial mobile devices. This 
section compares the visual results and render times of hemisphere shading algorithms 
rendered with OpenGL ES versus desktop ray tracing algorithms rendered with Mental Ray 
on Maya.
In this section, the OpenGL ES rendering time is ﬁxed and deﬁned by the iOS 
GLKViewController frame rate speed of 30 FPS, or approximately 0.03 seconds. In order to 
reduce experimental bias, both algorithms use the same Dragon model, very similar 
projection views, the same resolution (480x320), and particular care has been taken to 
approximate the model transformations (translate, rotate, scale).
A particular point of note is that the the desktop setup does not have access to instantaneous 
gyroscope data, highlighting an inherent advantage of the mobile device
7.2.1. Hemisphere Lighting
Hemisphere lighting in OpenGL ES attempts to simulate global illumination in Mental Ray. 
In the desktop setup, the model lies between two actual vertical polygonal planes.
Test Parameters:
Sky RGB colour: (135, 206, 235) Ground RGB colour: (77, 189, 51)
Fig. 25a: Hemisphere lighting (T), Fig. 25b: Hemisphere lighting (F), Fig. 25c: Hemisphere lighting (B),
Gyroscope ≈ -90º Gyroscope ≈ 0º Gyroscope ≈ 90º
Fig. 25d: Global illumination (T), Fig. 25e: Global illumination (F), Fig. 25f: Global illumination (B),
Render time ≈ 4.0 seconds Render time ≈ 5.0 seconds Render time ≈ 4.0 seconds
Page 36 of 65The ﬁrst thing to note is that Mental Ray uses many parameters to perform the render 
(including ﬁnal gathering), explaining the darker blue and green colours. Nonetheless, the 
results are very different from each other.
Global illumination produces a much more accurate render of the top (Fig. 25d) and bottom 
views (Fig. 25f), each shading the object entirely in shades of their respective sky and ground 
planes. This is mostly the case for hemisphere lighting (Figs. 25a and 25c), but there is a 
noticeable amount of spill from the opposite hemisphere.
The front views are much more telling as global illumination (Fig. 25e) accurately simulates 
a dominance of the sky plane, since the direction of travel of natural illumination is top-to-
bottom (followed by ground-up reﬂections and many other combinations). In hemisphere 
lighting, a front view should theoretically render an equal blend of both hemisphere colours, 
but Fig. 25b shows a slight lighting dominance of the lower hemisphere.
Hemisphere lighting is far from convincingly simulating global illumination, but the render 
times disclose that global illumination is far from real-time performance.
7.2.2. Hemisphere Occlusion
Hemisphere occlusion in OpenGL ES attempts to simulate ambient occlusion in Mental Ray. 
Results are further compared to default rendering with ambient light in Maya, also using 
Mental Ray.
Test Parameters:
Light intensity: 0.9 Shadow intensity: 0.1
Fig. 26a: Hemisphere occlusion (T), Fig. 26b: Hemisphere occlusion (F), Fig. 26c: Hemisphere occlusion (B),
Gyroscope ≈ -90º Gyroscope ≈ 0º Gyroscope ≈ 90º
Fig. 26d: Ambient occlusion (T), Fig. 26e: Ambient occlusion (F), Fig. 26f: Ambient occlusion (B),
Render time ≈ 15.0 seconds Render time ≈ 13.0 seconds Render time ≈ 12.0 seconds
Page 37 of 65Fig. 26g: Default illumination (T), Fig. 26h: Default illumination (F), Fig. 26i: Default illumination (B),
Render time ≈ 1.0 seconds Render time ≈ 2.0 seconds Render time ≈ 1.0 seconds
Once again, Mental Ray uses many parameters to control the ﬁnal render, resulting in 
intensities outside the bounds speciﬁed. However, we can deﬁnitely see much more 
similarity between the techniques and the shape of the model is very neatly deﬁned in all 
cases.
The render times for ambient occlusion (Figs. 26d-f) instantly stand out at a staggering 13.33 
seconds average per image. This clearly indicates that ray-traced ambient occlusion is still a 
long way away from real-time rendering.
The front views (Figs. 26b, 26e, and 26h) show that the hemisphere occlusion pass is 
noticeably darker than the ambient occlusion pass, caused by a dominance of the shadow 
hemisphere. It is very similar to the default illumination though, which has a surprisingly 
high render time of 2.0 seconds given it’s simplicity.
Since there is no additional geometry in the ray-traced scenes, the model is not occluded by 
a ground plane and hence has a high visibility factor. This produces an accurate, but 
incorrect render of the models if they were viewed on a mobile device. The top views (Figs. 
26d and 26g) have a very similar intensity distribution to the bottom views (Figs. 26f and 
26i), when in reality the former should be much lighter than the latter. Thanks to the 
instantaneous gyroscope roll data, hemisphere occlusion renders these views correctly with 
a light top (Fig. 26a) and a dark bottom (Fig. 26c).
For this last reason, baked lighting - previously-rendered lighting information stored as a 
texture map (e.g. per-vertex ambient occlusion coefﬁcients) - is an unsuitable alternative to 
ambient occlusion on OpenGL ES because the compositing tool needs the ability to view the 
model from any angle, rather than a single pre-determined position.
7.3. Environment Mapping
This section examines the resulting renders of reﬂective and refractive materials using two 
different types of environment mapping. Emphasis is placed on the mapping techniques, 
rather than the accuracy of the reﬂection and refraction calculations. For the comparative 
performance analysis, both applications render the refractive test sphere model.
Page 38 of 657.3.1. Cube Map
Test Parameters:
Synthetic cube map Captured cube map

Re#ection (Synthetic) Re#ection (Captured) Refraction (Synthetic) Refraction (Captured)
The test spheres clearly show the seams between the captured cube map faces (Figs. 27b and 
27d). A lot of time and effort from this project could have been devoted to creating a 
seamless cube map by implementing stitching algorithms directly [Brown and Lowe, 2003; 
2007] or setting up a system to interface with remote applications such as Autostitch [Brown, 
2011]. Both methods would considerably slow down the system pipeline and needlessly 
spend time solving a problem with an already well-known solution. Figs. 27f and 27h show 
that simply using an unstitched cube map produces very accurate preview-quality results, 
with less noticeable seams on rich models (such as the pictured Stanford bunny).
The cube map and its matrix transformations are highly responsive to device sensor data, 
resulting in an instant and accurate calculation of the camera orientation within the 
environment.

Fig. 28d: Mask, Fig. 28e: Mask, Fig. 28f: Mask,
Live feed refraction (1) Live feed refraction (2) Live feed re#ection
Mapping refractions from a live environment produces a highly realistic effect that will 
composite exceptionally well for any model and background (Figs. 28a, 28b, 28d, and 28e). 
Live reﬂections (Figs. 28c and 28f) on the other hand, are a largely pointless feature for now 
due to the reduced quality of the front-facing camera and the inability to render a 
simultaneous view from the back-facing camera (i.e. the scene). However, the concept is 
there for the taking when future device improvements come along.
There is a slight visual limitation in the live 
feed feature though, only noticeable with 
certain setups. The mask model in Fig. 29a 
should be refracting light from the green 
and black bands in the background, but it 
isn’t. This is because the sampling area for 
the live mapping doesn’t contain these 
elements, as seen in Fig. 29b. Just like in the 
data capture stage, the sampled texture is 
taken from a cropped version of the camera 
view with dimensions 256x256 in order to 
comply with OpenGL ES requirements 
(square, power-of-two textures). A larger 
Fig. 29a: Live feed error Fig. 29b: Live feed sampling

even more inaccurate refractions, by over-
sampling the camera view.

Fig. 30: Comparative performance analysis - Cube Map vs. Live Feed
Finally, a comparative performance analysis (Fig. 30) really highlights how costly live feed 
rendering is compared to its cube map counterpart. The task is twice as expensive in terms 
of memory and CPU consumption, and an astounding 11 times slower in the rendering rate - 
which may or may not be considered real-time performance, depending on the strictness of 
the term’s deﬁnition.
7.4. Colour Correction
7.4.1. Intensity Adjustments
In this section, the test implementation renders a greyscale, untextured Gargoyle model. The 
scene needs some form of lighting/shading to perform properly, for which I have chosen 
hemisphere occlusion with ambient light. As usual, the hemisphere occlusion algorithm 
extracts its intensity priors from the environment.
Test Parameters:
Ambient: 1.00; Diffuse: 0.00; Specular: 0.00; Gloss: 1.0; Daylight: 1.00; Sunlight; 0.00
Hemisphere Occlusion: YES
High brightness/contrast Low brightness/contrast Normal brightness/contrast
Page 41 of 65Fig. 31a: Intensity (High), Fig. 31b: Intensity (High), Fig. 31c: Intensity (High),
Adjustment value = 0.0 Adjustment value = 0.5 Adjustment value = 1.0
Fig. 31d: Intensity (Low), Fig. 31e: Intensity (Low), Fig. 31f: Intensity (Low),
Adjustment value = 0.0 Adjustment value = 0.5 Adjustment value = 1.0
Fig. 31g: Intensity (Normal), Fig. 31h: Intensity (Normal), Fig. 31i: Intensity (Normal),

Fig. 31j: Histogram (Normal), Fig. 31k: Histogram (Normal), Fig. 31l: Histogram (Normal),
? = 69.10 ? = 66.75 ? = 66.70
In this section, both intensity adjustment algorithms (brightness and contrast) have been 
combined into a single procedure. The results are very pleasing, as the fully adjusted models 
(value = 1.0; Figs. 31c, 31f, and 31l) composite very well with the background and there is a 
clear difference between the three different environments. For the sake of brevity, only 
histograms for the normal environment are displayed, where the standard deviation value 
drops from 69.10 (no adjustment) to 66.70 (full adjustment) signifying a closer distribution of 
intensities.
Page 42 of 657.4.2. Colour Matching
For the following results, the models have no shading or lighting associations and are 
simply coloured by their respective textures. The results have been analysed with the same 
histogram tool as the intensity adjustment algorithm but the full output has been omitted, 
including only the standard deviation, ’, for presentation purposes.
Test Parameters:
Blue/cyan saturation Green/yellow saturation Red/magenta saturation
Fig. 32a: Colour (Blue/cyan), Fig. 32b: Colour (Blue/cyan), Fig. 32c: Colour (Blue/cyan),
Adjustment value = 0.0, ? = 79.16 Adjustment value = 0.5, ? = 78.73 Adjustment value = 1.0, ? = 78.47
Fig. 32d: Colour (Green/yellow), Fig. 32e: Colour (Green/yellow), Fig. 32f: Colour (Green/yellow),
Adjustment value = 0.0, ? = 79.81 Adjustment value = 0.5, ? = 79.40 Adjustment value = 1.0, ? = 78.70
Fig. 32g: Colour (Red/magenta), Fig. 32h: Colour (Red/magenta), Fig. 32i: Colour (Red/magenta),
Adjustment value = 0.0, ? = 84.54 Adjustment value = 0.5, ? = 84.17 Adjustment value = 1.0, ? = 83.99
The algorithm is successful in performing a correct colour transfer, with noticeable 
differences amongst the three environments. The standard deviation behaves as expected, 
decreasing in value as the colour distribution moves closer together (exhibiting the 
Page 43 of 65appropriate inverse relationship with the adjustment value). However, these results aren’t as 
rich as the ones presented by Reinhard et al. [2001; 2004] in their original publications, even 
with a full adjustment. Furthermore, the algorithm’s results are less than satisfactory when 
applied to models with textures dominated by shades of a single colour (Figs. 33a-f). Due to 
OpenGL ES limitations, it’s difﬁcult to deduce where the problems exist since access to 
shader output data is strictly forbidden (the OpenGL ES server only delivers fully rendered 
images to the frame buffer).

7.5. Full Implementation
To conclude the testing and results section, Figs. 34a-f showcase a selection of compositions 
using the full range of modelling and algorithm tools available to the application. Each 
image attempts to highlight a certain aspect of the implementation, but the ultimate goal is 
to create interesting preview-quality composites.

Page 45 of 658. Further Work
8.1. Attainable Extensions
The topics discussed in this section can extend the application without drastically modifying 
the current structure. They were not implemented in the ﬁnal solution due to either limited 
time constraints or low degree of added value.
8.1.1. Texture Compression
Block compression with the PVRTC format [Imagination Technologies Limited, 2012] is the 
recommended approach to reducing texture memory usage. There is a lot of boilerplate code 
involved in the setup, but this format could boost performance of the live feed environment 
mapping function, bypassing the write/read cycle in generating a PNG image. Mipmaps 
could boost the quality (and performance) of the models by caching multiple textures of 
different dimensions for appropriate size sampling, depending on the current view.
8.1.2. Higher Resolution
The application currently renders the camera view at a resolution of 480x320, which is 
actually a quarter of the available display (960x640). Careful data management and 
performance optimisation could free-up processing bandwidth in order to accommodate the 
higher resolution. Special care needs to be taken though, since this would cause a knock-on 
effect on the rest of the application such as increased texture sizes of the environment 
(256x256 to 512x512).
8.1.3. Bump Mapping
Bump mapping is a texturing effect for rendering rough surfaces without affecting a model’s 
geometry, only its appearance by modifying its normals. This technique is very useful for 
uneven material surfaces, such as wood or stone. This simply requires an additional 2D 
texture attachment in OpenGL ES and the accompanying shader code.
8.1.4. Multiple Materials
The application currently supports a single material for the whole model. This is a very basic 
and inﬂexible type of modelling which renders quite unrealistic objects (for example, a real 
car will have shiny rims with matte tires). An MTL ﬁle usually accompanies an OBJ ﬁle with  
per-face shading data. Behrens’ python script [2012] only supports OBJ conversion to 
readable OpenGL ES header ﬁles, but a similar tool could be developed to parse MTL ﬁles, 
with a corresponding modiﬁcation to the shader code.
8.2. Alternative Implementations
The methods featured in this section are not suitable for use within the current application 
and would require a massive concept, system, and implementation redesign. They would 
likely need both an extra post-processing stage and communication with a dedicated server 
for additional memory and processing power. The real-time characteristic would be all but 
lost, but the rendering and compositing would gain a massive boost in quality.
Page 46 of 658.2.1. Ray Tracing
Ray tracing is common computer graphics techniques which generate images by tracing the 
path of light from pixels on a viewing plane to objects in a virtual scene. Ray casting 
performs the reverse procedure, casting rays from objects and tracing them through the 
virtual scene to the view plane.
The thoroughly discussed ambient occlusion algorithm is a form of ray tracing. A similar 
effect useful to the application is self-reﬂection with multiple depth passes. Ray-traced 
refractions create wonderful images by tracing the path of light all the way through a 
transparent object.
Ray casting can be used to create shadows, but in an AR application it would be very 
difﬁcult to map these accurately onto real objects (and even more difﬁcult to map real 
shadows onto virtual objects). Shadow detection/generation is a common and highly 
challenging problem in 2D scenes, but work in this ﬁeld [Chuang et al., 2003; Guo et al., 
2011] shows promising techniques for automated shadow matting relevant to compositing. 
Nonetheless, shadows could work really well on ﬂat, clear foregrounds (e.g. an open ﬁeld) 
adding realism to a scene by anchoring synthetic objects to the ground and transmitting 
size/depth.
8.2.2. Image-Based Techniques
Image-based techniques include modelling (IBM), lighting (IBL), and rendering (IBR), all of 
which have been discussed in Section 2.1. The common idea is that a set of 2D images is 
used to generate a 3D environment recreating the real world. This approach requires 
specialised equipment as well as a render farm, leaving the device to simply be used as a 
basic motion capture sensor for orientation and location data, annotating a large set of 
reference images.
8.2.3. Post-Processing
Image post-processing with shaders [Munshi, 2009] and [Rost and Licea-Kane, 2009] is the 
most attainable and least disruptive goal in this section. The current application would still 
remain as a real-time, context-aware preview tool, but the ﬁnal composite algorithms would 
occur in a post-processing stage. If the preview results are rendered off-screen to a frame 
buffer OpenGL ES object, then kernel/convolution-based image-processing techniques can 
be implemented at the shader level to act on this data and then overlay the resulting render 
onto the camera view image. Image post-processing techniques that would beneﬁt the 
composite include blurring and light blooming.
8.3. Technology Upgrades
43
 iPhone 5, iOS 6 , 
This section takes a quick glance at the relevant features of the upcoming
OpenGL ES 3.0, and GLSL ES 3.0 technologies.
43
 At the time of this document’s submission: 
• ?e iPhone 5 and iOS 6 have just completed their worldwide release.
• ?e OpenGL ES 3.0 speci"cation has been announced but not yet implemented.
Page 47 of 658.3.1. iPhone 5 & iOS 6
The main upgrades of the new device include a larger display (640x1136), better camera 
quality (8 MP), increased processing power (dual-core CPU and triple-core GPU), and 
increased memory (1 GB RAM).
iOS 6 includes the new function CVOpenGLESTextureCache for fast-loading a camera view as 
an OpenGL ES texture (incredible news for the live feed algorithm). New camera APIs 
include exposure control, which could be very useful for HDR image capture.
8.3.2. OpenGL ES 3.0 & GLSL ES 3.0
OpenGL ES 3.0 mainly upgrades texture-centric features such as a standard compression 
function, non-power-of-two compatibility, and spherical maps (useful for most IBL 
methods). It also implements occlusion queries for minimising function calls and computing 
time.
 
GLSL ES 3.0 includes full support for 32-bit integer and ﬂoating point operations, removing 
many previous shader limitations.
Page 48 of 659. Conclusions
The device has been investigated to its limit and the resulting tool succeeds in delivering 
preview-quality composites rendered in real-time, using a direct approach with minimal 
user input. The novel solution bypasses traditional compositing techniques and effectively 
combines all relevant sensor, user, and model data into an efﬁcient system. The two new 
concepts developed - colour priors and hemisphere occlusion - will hopefully become a useful 
point of reference for future projects in this relatively new ﬁeld of context-aware 
compositing. Similarly, this thesis will hopefully serve as a useful literature survey on the 
current state of compositing on embedded systems compared to desktop PCs.
On a personal note, this has been my most rewarding experience in computer science and 
largest achievement in the ﬁeld. With the new iOS 6 and iPhone 5 just released, a whole 
world of Android devices to explore, an additional post-processing phase, and time on my 
hands, all I can say is let’s keep going!

Executive Summary 
Information  has  been  increasing  since  the  birth  of  technology,  hence  it  is 
getting  difficult  to  analyze  and  understand  all  the  information  we  have. 
Information  is  increasing  rapidly whereas  the methods  to visualize  the data 
have not changed as often. Thus researchers are faced with a problem, as they 
cannot analyze such an amount of data, if it is not represented correctly. 
Visualizing data  in a manner  that  is scalable has always been a challenge  in 
the filed of computer science. The Internet and biology are two main sources 
of rapid increase in information, in this project I am trying to understand the 
current methods of visualizations and changing them to fit an environments 
in which  data  is  expanded  very  rapidly which makes  it  very  interesting  as 
well as challenging. 
In this project I am trying to solve this problem using data visualization as the 
best  way  to  show  any  information  is  through  visual  means;  that  is  my 
approach  to  this problem. Humans  are naturally  good  at detecting patterns 
and giving a graphical representation of the data would allow them to make 
observations which were not possible using previous approaches. 
To solve the problem I have used a technique to dynamically generate graphs 
and  to show the data  in an elegant manner, as  the data  to be shown on  the 
graph increases the previous values are moved in order to give priority to the 
new data. This technique is being used to display trees with a huge number of 
nodes.  This  technique  is  not  affected  by  the  increase  in  the  amount  of  data 
and hence a sound approach to the problem. 
This  technique mainly  focuses on  trees but  it  can be applied  to display vast 
numbers  of  data  types.  This  method  uses  similar  but  richer  and  more 
dynamic visualization, than visualization methods currently used, and allows 
users  to  view  data  in  a  more  appropriate  manner  without  having  to 
understand the new system.

Web Services and Data Visualization in the Browser 
                                                       University of Bristol -??? Computer Science                               3 
Introduction  
Information has been increasing since the birth of technology. The amount of 
information on the Internet  is enormous. When scientists started to discover 
secrets  about  life  and  its  building  block  that  is  DNA.  The  field  of  biology 
started generating a lot of data. Now we have hierarchies of genomes and lot 
of information about their sequences. As such, a large source of information is 
the online  results of biological experimentation. When  this much amount of 
information  started  to  generate,  biology  joined  hands  with  Information 
Technology  to  give  birth  to  bioinformatics.  To  process  and  understand  this 
information  a  lot  of  computing  techniques  such  statistical  analysis,  data 
mining and result visualization were used in bioinformatics. 
 
The rise in the amount of information is useful but has its affects as well. Now 
that  so  much  information  is  available  to  us.  We  can’t  visualize  that 
information correctly and neither can we share that information effectively, as 
everyone  uses  his  or  her  own  way  to  show  the  information.  This  project 
discusses  the  problems  that we  have  because  of  the  amount  of  information 
that we have today. 
 
In  this  report  first we will  have  an  overview  about web  services,  how  they 
work  and  why  do  we  need  web  services  from  there  we  move  on  to 
visualization  and  why  it  is  important  to  have  a  clear  and  effective 
visualization. We will than briefly discuss the field of bioinformatics and how 
Information Technology contributes to the field of biology. 
 
Moreover,  we  will  look  at  some  of  the  problems  that  exist  because  of  the 
amount and characteristics of the data in the field of biology. Further more we 
will see how a technique to visualize the data using AJAX can be applied to 
rectify  this  problem. We will  also discuss  how web  services  can  be used  to 
solve some of problems researchers have today.  
 
The dataset that I will be using to present and solve this problem is from the 
superfamily database  that holds  information  about  genomes  and proteins.  I 
will  talk about why this dataset  is a good choice for this project  further  into 
the report. 
 
This  would  give  us  a  good  idea  about  some  of  the  problems  faced  and  a 
possible  solution.  Further  into  the  report  we  will  see  how  this  system  has 
been designed, implemented and most importantly the results of the system. 
Finally we will  evaluate  the  system based on  the objectives and opinions of 
people about the system.  
Web Services and Data Visualization in the Browser 
                                                       University of Bristol -??? Computer Science                               4 
Goal 
Goal of the project 
The  goal  of  the  project  is  to  improve  the  data  visualization  methods 
implemented on the SUPERFAMILY database and introduce web services so 
that the data can be retrieved in a standard format. 
Features and benefits 
The system features all the required functions of the superfamily database to 
be  available  through  a  web  service  interface,  and  also  incorporates  the 
visualization  of  the  data  from  the  database.  The  visualization  will  be 
interactive, informative and will change and adapt according to users needs. 
Background and Motivation 
Setting and History 
Web  services  are  common  and  are  being  used  in most  of  the  new  systems 
being developed. Amazon is also one of the companies using it, with products 
like  S3  storage  service,  EC2  compute  cloud,  and SimpleDB online database. 
There are a lot of advantages of using web services as it allows sending data 
in a standard format, allowing everyone to be able to use it as desired. [1] 
 
If  I  talk  about  research  in  bioinformatics  that  is  the  combination  of  biology 
and Information Technology. No matter where a person lives, whatever is his 
social  background, he  always wants  to  get  the  best  and  correct  information 
available  on  the  Internet  and  get  it  easily.[2]  Current  methods  of 
visualizations are not good enough to represent the data in a manner that can 
clearly and effectively provide the information to the user. 
Bioinformatics 
Bioinformatics is the combination of Information Technology with biology. It 
began  with  designing  database  to  store  information  about  genomic  data, 
which was producing a lot of information. It also required that an interface be 
provided which would be complex as to show the existing information from 
the database and allow addition of more information as well which extended 
it  to  web.  Now  bioinformatics  deals  with  more  complex  things  than  just 
storing data from the genome revolution, as this new amount of information 
is  huge  things  like  data  mining,  machine  learning  algorithms,  data 
visualization  are  also  required  as  visualization  needs  to  incorporate  these 
techniques such as data mining on the biological data. [36] 
Web Services and Data Visualization in the Browser 
                                                       University of Bristol -??? Computer Science                               5 
HTML 
Hypertext Markup Language is a markup language for web pages. As DNA is 
building  block  of  life  similarly  we  can  say  HTML  is  building  block  for 
webpages. HTML consists of tags that are enclosed in angle brackets. 
A simple HTML page would look like this 
 
<html> 
<head> 
 <title>MSc</title> 
</head> 
<body> 
Web Services and Data Visualization 
</body> 
</html> 
Listing 1: simple HTML page with ‘MSc’ on the title bar of the browser and ‘Web Services and Data 
Visualization’ in the page. 
HTML  as  seen  in  Listing  1  has  always  been  used  to  communicate  between 
server  and  the  user.  The  user  would  submit  a  form  and  the  server  would 
respond to the request of the user. This was working fine but after some time 
users of the application started complaining about the speed of the response 
they get, they were not satisfied with the responsiveness of the server. [7] 
 
A simple HTML form that user would submit would be something like this 
 
<html> 
<head> 
 <title>MSc</title> 
</head> 
<body> 
<form name="unameForm" action="server page" method="get"> 
Username: <input type="text" name="uname" /> 
<input type="submit" value="Submit" /> 
</form> 
</body> 
</html> 
Listing 2: Simple HTML form 
The  trend  shifted  towards  improving  the  servers,  to  improve  the 
responsiveness of the server but still after some time users still thought it was 
not good enough. Then  came AJAX  it  changed  the  concept of moving  from 
page to page for information and gave a true application based environment 
on the web. [7] 
 
Web Services and Data Visualization in the Browser 
                                                       University of Bristol -??? Computer Science                               6 
AJAX 
AJAX  stands  for  Asynchronous  JavaScript  and  XML.  It  allows  web 
application to send data to and from the server asynchronously.  
 
Some of the major benefits of AJAX include 
• User-??? interface 
• Reduces refresh rate 
• Increases client responsiveness [37] 
 
How AJAX does all this? Let’s see a basic diagram of how AJAX makes a call 
and responds. 
 
               Figure 1: AJAX call                                                                                                    Source: [6] 
The  diagram  illustrates  how  a  user  invokes  a  call  from  the  user  interface, 
which  invokes  the  request  object,  to  communicate  with  the  webserver  and 
return  the data  in XML,  that data  is  the  retrieved by  the  request object  and 
displayed on the webpage. [6] 
Web Service 
Web service allows the communications based on standards using HTTP and 
XML-???based  messaging.  Web  services  can  be  used  to  perform  simple  and 
complex  tasks.  As  they  are  based  on  open  standards  such  as  HTTP,  XML, 
SOAP  and  WSDL  they  are  not  dependent  on  things  like  hardware, 
programing  language,  and  even  the  operating  system.  Enabling  application 
on different hardware made in different programming language and using a 
different operating  system  to  easily  communicate with  each other using  the 
web service. [25] 
  
Web Services and Data Visualization in the Browser 
                                                       University of Bristol -??? Computer Science                               7 
Web  services  are  based  on  XML  and  have  three  important  components 
WSDL, SOAP and UDDI. 
 
The first component is WSDL. When the web service is being created a WSDL 
documents  is  created which  has  all  the  information  about  the web  service, 
such  as  its  location  and  the  functionality  it  will  provide.  The  second 
component is UDDI is an optional part but can be important for some. Once 
the  WSDL  is  created  its  information  is  than  added  to  UDDI  registry  this 
allows the web services to be searched and found by the people willing to use 
it. Based on the information in the UDDI registry its gets the instructions from 
the WSDL  document.  SOAP messages  are  than  formed  that  are  exchanged 
between the services over HTTP. [25] 
XML 
XML is a W3C standard which defines a meta-???language for describing data. 
XML is basis of all modern web services as they use XML based technologies 
to explain their interface and encode their messages. WSDL, UDDI and SOAP 
and all XML based technologies and can be interpreted by any machine. [25] 
WSDL  
WSDL  is  also  a  standard  set  by W3C  for  describing web  services.  Anyone 
who wants to access the web service and can read and interpret it. It provides 
all  the details  to  the user or  the program requesting  it,  that  from where  the 
service can be accessed what functionality is provided by the web service and 
what protocols should be used to communicate with the web service. [25] 
 
A WSDL file as discussed above is based on XML and has six main elements: 
 
1. Port Type – groups and describes the operations performed by service 
2. Port – specifies an address for binding 
3. Message – describes the names and format of the messages supported 
4. Types – defines the data type used for sending data between client and 
server 
5. Binding  –  defines  the  communication  protocols  supported  by  the 
operations 
6. Service – specifies the URL for accessing the service 
 
This documents is a contract between the client and the server if the rules are 
followed communication can be done. [25] 
UDDI 
UDDI  is a  standard, which  is  sponsored by OASIS.  It  is often  referred  to as 
yellow pages of web services. It also based on XML it allows business to list 
Web Services and Data Visualization in the Browser 
                                                       University of Bristol -??? Computer Science                               8 
their web services. They can be private or public. The communication is done 
through SOAP. A developer willing to use the service can query UDDI to find 
the service. [25] 
Types of Web Service 
SOAP 
Microsoft developed SOAP that is “Simple Object Access Protocol” in the year 
1988 and since than it has become a standard in web services. It is used in web 
services  combined  with  WSDL  and  XML  to  exchange  messages.  [9] 
[13][14][21] 
 
It  is  also  a W3C  standard  and  the  ability  for  SOAP  to  exchange  messages 
between clients irrespective of the programming language is what made it an 
important  in  web  services.  Same  as  WSDL,  SOAP  is  also  an  XML  based 
document has these elements 
 
1. Envelope  –  specifies  that  the  xml  documents  is  SOAP  message; 
encloses the message itself 
2. Header -??? this is optional it has information related to message the time, 
authentication data etc. 
3. Body -???  has the message pay load 
4. Fault  –  this  is  optional  as  well  it  contains  the  error  within  a  SOAP 
message. 
 
Data  between  users  and web  services  is  exchanged  based  on  SOAP  as  it  is 
mentioned  in  the  WSDL  contract  web  service  is  guaranteed  to  work  with 
SOAP.  The  data  is  exchanged  using  request  and  response  SOAP 
messages.[25] 
The basic structure of a SOAP object: 
 
<env:Envelope xmlns:env="?http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-???envelope"?> 
 <env:Header> 
     <!-???-??? Header information here -???-???> 
 </env:Header> 
 <env:Body> 
    <!-???-??? Body -???-???> 
 </env:Body> 
</env:Envelope> 
Listing 3: Basic SOAP Structure 
This  is  the  basic  structure  now  lets  see  how  can we use  SOAP  to  request  a 
stock quote. 
 
Web Services and Data Visualization in the Browser 
                                                       University of Bristol -??? Computer Science                               9 
So a basic example of SOAP for requesting a stock quote from a web service 
would look something like the following: 
The request: 
GET /StockValue HTTP/1.1 
Host: auction.org 
Content-???Type: application/soap+xml; charset=utf-???8 
Content-???Length: xxx 
<?xml version="?1.0"??> 
<env:Envelope xmlns:env="?http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-???envelope"? 
   xmlns:s="?http://www.auction.org/StockValue"?> 
   <env:Body> 
     <s:GetStockValue> 
          <s:Item>APPLE</s:Item> 
     </s:GetStockValue> 
   </env:Body> 
</env:Envelope> 
Listing 4: SOAP request for Stock Value 
The  request  clearly  shows  the host  to which  the  request has been made  the 
content  type  and  the  item  for  which  the  value  is  required.  To  understand 
further we see the response of this request. 
 The response: 
 HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
Content-???Type: application/soap+xml; charset=utf-???8 
Content-???Length: xxx 
 
<?xml version="?1.0"??> 
<env:Envelope xmlns:env="?http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-???envelope"? 
   xmlns:s="?http://www.auction.org/StockValue"?> 
   <env:Body> 
     <s:GetStockValueResponse> 
          <s:StockValue>1499</s:StockValue> 
     </s:GetStockValueResponse> 
   </env:Body> 
</env:Envelope> 
Listing 5: SOAP response for stock value 
The  response  shows  the  value  that  has  been  returned  for  the  stock  is  1499. 
This  gives  a  general  idea  on  how  SOAP works.  To  see  actual  requests  and 
response of this system see Listing 8 
Web Services and Data Visualization in the Browser 
                                                       University of Bristol -??? Computer Science                               10 
REST 
“REST was  introduced  by Roy  Fielding  in  his  thesis  in which  he wrote  the 
main idea of REST (Representative State Transfer). It is based on architectural 
style and it can be explained easily by comparing the 4 words.” [9][21] 
 
HTTP  Equivalent 
GET  Read 
POST  Create, update, delete 
PUT  Create, update 
DELETE  Delete 
Table 1: Rest HTTP equivalent 
So to give a similar example of a RESTful service compared to SOAP we use 
the same scenario as in SOAP  
The request: 
 GET /StockValue/APPLE HTTP/1.1 
Host: auction.org 
Accept: text/xml 
Accept-???Charset: utf-???8 
Listing 6: REST request for stock value 
The response: 
 HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
Content-???Type: text/xml; charset=utf-???8 
Content-???Length: xxx 
 
<?xml version="?1.0"??> 
<s:Quote xmlns:s="?http://auction.org/StockValue"?> 
     <s:Stock>IBM</s:Stock> 
     <s:StockValue>1499</s:StockValue> 
</s:Quote> 
Listing 7: REST response for stock value 
The RESTful compared to SOAP is much lighter in weight and simpler to use 
as well  when  comparing  to  SOAP,  as  SOAP  sends HTTP  requests  and  the 
load of XML for the action of the request. [9] SOAP is more general and can 
have any kind of action where as REST is better for database interaction. 
Benefits 
Web services has many advantages using them can lead to technological and 
even business benefits. Some of these benefits are 
 
1. Application and data integration 
2. Code re-???use

3. Time Effectiveness 
4. Supported on more platforms. 
 
Application and data integration 
Web service does not need to know on which system or on which language it 
is being  implemented or used.  It  can be  integrated with applications, which 
are in different language than the service is implemented in. [25]  
 
Code Re-???user and Time effectiveness 
One  of  the most  important  benefits  is  re-???use:  once  a  web  service  has  been 
created it can be used by many applications, if the functionality requires that 
service. These benefits result in time effectiveness of the over all system as it 
supports  all  platforms  that  communicate  based  on  a  WSDL  mediated 
contract, these platforms are both innumerable and varied. Hence no need to 
implement a different service for every platform. [25] 
Data Visualization 
The Gestalt law of proximity states that 
 "?Objects  or  shapes  that  are  close  to  one  another  appear  to  form  groups"?. 
Even if the shapes, sizes, and objects are radically different, they will appear 
as a group if they are close together. [33] 
 
This principle is also known as  “grouping”, which means that when objects 
are put  together  they make more  sense  than  if  the object  is  seen  separately. 
Hence if you consider one piece of information you would not be able to get 
that much  information but  if you put  together  similar pieces of  information 
together and view that, it is more likely to give more information. [33][34] 
 
Data  visualization  is  very  important when  creating  a  system.  If  the  system 
does not present the data in a manner that could be easily interpreted by the 
user, the chances are user will not use your system again, if an alternative is 
available. To ensure  that  this does not happen with  the system built.  I have 
used toolkits to give an elegant yet informative display. 
 
The  question  is why  is  data  visualization  so  important,  that  it  is  a  separate 
field in computer science. Lets take a simple example. Consider the letters in 
Figure 2. Now lets try finding the number of times the letter ‘V’ repeats in this 
figure. 
Web Services and Data Visualization in the Browser 
                                                       University of Bristol -??? Computer Science                               12 
 
                                   Figure 2: Visualization Example 1            Source: [7] 
It seems to be a little hard doesn’t it? Yes you can count the number of times 
the letter ‘V’ repeats but it would take you a little time. Some times you might 
even have  to  start  again,  for  something  that  should be  easy and  should not 
consume that much time. 
 
                                        Figure 3: Visualization Example 2                Source: [7] 
Now  consider  Figure  3. Now  try  to  count  the  number  of  times  the  letter V 
repeats.  Simple  isn’t  it.  The  reason  is  better  visualization because what  you 
wanted  to  see  was  visualized  correctly.  There  is  a  vast  difference  in  the 
amount  of  time  required  to  do  the  same  thing  on  the  same  data  set,  the 
difference is the result of visualization. If the data set is visualized accurately 
you can get the information very quickly if not it can be very time consuming. 
 
Gestalt theory states that 
 “Things which share visual characteristics such as shape, size, color, texture, 
or value will be seen as belonging together in the viewer’s mind.” [33] 
 
Hence if the information being displayed has similar visual characteristics it is 
likely  that  the viewer will not be  easily able  to distinguish, which  is why  it 
was not easy to locate the ‘V’ in the first image, but it was comparatively easy 
in the second image. [33][34] 
 
The example we considered has a very basic data set. It was very simple and 
yet  the  difference  in  both  the  visualization  is  enormous.  This  gives  a  good 
idea on why visualization  is  important. Now consider a data set, which has 
more than 10,000 values. It might not even be possible to get the information 
clearly  and effectively  if  the visualization  is not  accurate.  If  the  information 
can be retrieved it would be very time consuming. This projects aims to use 
the raw data and visualize the data in a manner that would give the result of 
the  example  above.  So  that  researchers  can  focus  on  the  information  they 
actually want instead of spending valuable time in getting the information.

                                                       University of Bristol -??? Computer Science                               13 
The system developed tries  to achieve the balance between showing a  lot of 
information or too little information and tries to show the accurate amount of 
data  that  should  be  shown.  System will  not  in  anyway  replace  the  current 
visualization  as  these  visualization  may  be  required  in  some  cases  when 
looking  at  graphs  like  these  can  help  visualize  the  information  in  different 
way. When  lot of  information  is  shown  it will give a bird’s  eye-???view  to  the 
data and when information is less it would yield a more specific result. 
 
Goal of visualization in bioinformatics are 
1. To visualize huge amounts of data  
2. To improve and aid in pattern and trend recognition. 
 
Visualization is very important when considering biological data and hence I 
have considered different visualization libraries so that the data is visualized 
accurately. 
JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit 
JavaScript  InfoVis  Toolkit  gives  the  ability  to  draw many different  types  of 
graphs and has many visualization options as well. [12]

toolkit  has  many  more  functionality  and  is  a  complete  package  for 
implementing such graphs in a webpage.

Protovis 
This is another library that provides similar visualizations. 
 
Figure 5: Protovis Visualization Sample Source: [9] 
 
It  is  a  product  of  Stanford  Visualization  Group,  and  it  provides  similar 
functionalities [22] but after using both of the libraries I found that the JIT is 
more suitable and has options that can benefit the user more. For this reason I 
have used JIT in this project. 
 
SUPERFAMILY Database 
Superfamile database is a resource for comparative genomics/proteomics and 
is  based  on  hidden Markov models.  “The  purpose  of  SUPERFAMILY  is  to 
detect and classify in protein sequences evolutionary domains for which there 
is a known structural representative. Given a protein about which nothing is 
known  other  than  the  amino-???acid  sequence,  the  object  is  to  assign  known 
structural  domains  or  more  specifically  domains  at  the  SCOP  superfamily 
level.”[10][11] 
 
The  database  currently  is  accessible  using  either  a  cloud  image  or 
downloading the data and setting your own server, both of these solutions are 
not really suitable for a single novice biology user such as an undergraduate 
student. Even for me setting up the database was little troublesome. Trying to 
setup a database that is around 30GB in size can be little tricky. The database 
as  a  resource  for  comparative  genomics  is  not  as  well  exposed  as  the 
annotation assignment services that the website provides.  
 
The Superfamily database does provide some web services [15] but  they are 
not sufficient enough, I will talk about Distributed Annotation System and the 
Web Services and Data Visualization in the Browser 
                                                       University of Bristol -??? Computer Science                               15 
services  provided  later.  But  the  services  need  to  be  expanded  and  more 
functionality needs to be made publicly available through web services to the 
users. 
Web Services in Bio Informatics 
In  the  last  decade  the  ability  to  perform  experiments  and  research  has 
increased  a  lot  and  that  is  due  to  the  advancements  in  technology,  but  this 
research  and  experiments means  a  lot more  data.  Individual  researchers  or 
groups  all  around  the  world  produce  these  data.  As  the  technology  has 
advanced  that  information  is  available  on  the  Internet,  but  all  the  groups 
maintain  the data  sets  they have  themselves  and  they use  a  variety  of  data 
types and standards.  
 
This information is widely spread and in a form that an individual researcher 
cannot  get  all  that  information,  even  though  information  is  out  there.  They 
information  is  likely  to  be  disorganized HTTP  file  indexes  or  FTP with  no 
meta-???data  over  multiple  servers.  The  superfamily  database  is  built  from 
several hundred such sites by hand! Screen scraping fails on something like a 
JavaScript  driven  web  app  interface.  These  interfaces  are  common  with 
Genome  browsers  such  as  GBrowse  from  GMOD[35].  The  need  to  have  a 
system that allows that all the data is available in a manner that every person 
can use is vital. This gives rise to the need of web services in bio informatics.  
 
Another advantage of having web services is that it can be used with Taverna 
as Taverna works with WSDL Web  services  and would be  compatible with 
the web services developed. Taverna is a product of the myGrid team and is a 
domain-???independent  Workflow  Management  System.  It  provides  tools  to 
design and execute scientific workflows and aid in silico experimentation. [38] 
Web Services & SUPERFAMILY Database 
Superfamily in general wants to scale to the “Cloud” and implementing web 
services would be  a great way  to progress.  Since we  could have many web 
services servers and load balance them with DNS using services like Amazon 
Cloud  front.  This  project  introduces more  services  to  the users  so  that  they 
can access much more data from the superfamily database. 
 
The  superfamily  database  currently  provides  some  web  services  using  the 
DAS service specification. DAS stands for Distributed Annotation System. So 
users  go  to  DAS  registry  site  and  then  get  forwarded  to  the  distributed 
annotation  servers  for  which  superfamily  is  a  single  example.  Assignment 
here  is  assigning  an  informative  tag  to  a  biological  sequence;  in  the  case  of 
SUPERFAMILY,  tag  is  the  presence  and  absence  of  protein  domain  super

families. This project  is  focused on providing web services, which is outside 
of  this  scope  of  domain  assignment.  So  this  projects  does  not  replace  the 
current web services rather complements the system by adding new features. 
[31][32] 
Current Projects 
myGrid project 
myGrid  project  is  a  project  by  the  government  of  UK  under  its  E-???Science 
Programme.  This  project  has  adopted  the  technology  of  web  services  to 
provide an open source based web service to facilitate experiments in silico, in 
the field of biology. [2] 
 
Current Visualizations

The above  image  is a Binary  tree, which  is currently  implemented. This  is a 
portion of the graph as the information is a lot on a single graph to be easily 
understood and effectively retrieved by the user.

This is another implementation, which is currently being used. In this graph 
the information that is shown can be increased. 
  
Similarly  other  projects  like MOBY-???Services  and  Semantic-???MOBY  have  also 
implemented the new technology to solve the problem faced by the biologists. 
[2] They have command line tools already wrapped as SOAP/WSDL services 
but not a database.

PANTHER is a very similar service to SUPERFAMILY, so the use case is the 
same and so are the kinds of visualization to be done. The above page is from

to another pie chart that shows the details of that portion.

If that category has no lower level categories this message is displayed and is 
a dead end. You have to go back in your browser to change the query. The pie 
charts are not interactive as well. 
 
So,  Websites  providing  similar  information  do  have  some  kind  of 
visualization  but  that  visualization  is  not  good  enough,  it  makes  it  time 
consuming and hard for a researcher to go thorough the data and understand 
it.  Detecting  patterns  between  genome  statistics  becomes  very  hard,  as 
detecting patterns is much easier for humans rather than observing numbers. 
Some of  the current approaches  show  the data  in a  table and some of  them 
show  them  in  a  graph. Where  raw data  is  used  the problem of  understand 
large quantities of data arises. Where graphs have been used the information 
provided  is  very  limited,  the  graph  does  not  populate  data  as  the  user 
requests rather a graph containing all the information is shown. So these are 
some of problems in current approaches.  
Problem Statement 
When  we  talk  about  genomes,  proteins,  DNA  a  huge  amount  of  data  and 
large  databases  come  to  mind.  The  field  of  biology  and  bioinformatics 
requires  that  the  data  is  available  to  everyone.  Technology  has  spread  to 
almost  everything  now  days  and  this  field  have  also  adapted  technology. 
Some  of  the  information  and  databases  are  available  online  through World 
Wide Web  (WWW).  So  is  the problem solved? NO,  the data  can be viewed 
online but not received in a programmatic form so that it can be manipulated 
and processed for further research and experiments. Some of the researchers 
use  the  technique  of  screen  scraping  to  get  the  data.  This  technique  allows 
you to extract the information on the screen, but this is not a proper or even a 
long-???term solution. [2][20] 
 
Since technology has progressed so much and it is now capable to provide a 
system that can present complicated data in such an informative manner that 
the user can easily understand. The data available in the superfamily database 
is  being  used  in  a  specific manner,  people  who want  to  use  that  data  and 
process it in a different manner cannot do so directly.

Moreover, if I talk about supporting more platforms it would require that the 
user  would  have  to  actually  deal  with  SQL  servers  themselves  and  know 
SQL. All of which is not suitable for a naive user such as a Biologist. People 
on the other hand understand the use of a website. 
The  amount  of  information  available  today  is  immense,  hence  it  is  getting 
difficult  to  analyze  and  understand  the  entire  information  we  have. 
Information  is  increasing  rapidly whereas  the methods  to visualize  the data 
have not  changed  that  often. Thus  researchers  are  faced with  a problem,  as 
they  cannot  analyze  such  amount  of  data,  if  it  is  not  represented  correctly. 
Visualizing data  in a manner  that  is scalable has always been a challenge  in 
filed of computer science.  
Information  that needs  to be visualized  is huge and but  that  is not  the only 
thing.  Visualizing  that  much  information  is  a  tough  but  what  makes  it  a 
challenge  is  the  type of  the data  the biological sciences has, data  is not only 
non-???homogenous it also scales in a non-???linear way in places, and the relative 
importance  is  biological  and  numerical.  There  can  be  infinite  number  of 
mathematical projections and possible visualizations, but  the  challenge  is  to 
find the one that scientifically is the most meaningful and helps the biologist 
visualize the data. 
We looked at the biological importance of the data and its characteristics, but 
from  computer  science  point  of  view  the  data  that  I  have  is  complex  real-???
world data and which should make sense  in an analytical way. To visualize 
this type of data that should not only make sense in a biological manner but 
should  have  visualization  that  makes  it  easy,  for  the  user.  Even  with  the 
current advancements  in  technology  it makes  it a challenge  to visualize  this 
data. This approach to visualization frees the biologist to define what should 
be visualized and how, rather than limiting the analysis to something that is 
statically composed offline. 
Initial Business Case 
Considering  all  the  above  facts  and  considering  the  importance  of  web 
services  in  today’s world,  I  have  developed  in  this  project, web  services  to 
solve the problems and give the freedom to researchers to use the data as they 
wish, so that they can carry out their research more easily. As all the users do 
not wish  to  process  the  data  further,  a  visualization method  is  designed  to 
help  users  visualize  the  huge  amount  of  information  in  a  manner  that  is 
suitable,  fast  and  appropriate  to  the  needs  of  the  users.  Visualization 
technique  does  not  only  focus  on  this  field  or  type  of  data,  technique 
developed  can  be  applied  on  any  data,  similar  to  this  and  the  concept  can 
used in many of current visualization methods. 
Web Services and Data Visualization in the Browser

This project introduces a new way to visualize the data in bioinformatics. This 
is  a  new  approach  and  will  have  its  advantages  and  disadvantages.  Data 
visualization  implemented  in  the  system  is  such  that  user  only  sees  that 
information  that  he  requests  and  so  the  information  visualized  would  be 
accurate and exactly what the user wants. 
How is this different? 
The important question is what is so different about this project. What makes 
it’s  so  challenging  and  worth  making.  This  system  tries  to  overcome  the 
limitations of the system that already exists. Some of these systems have web 
services to provide data to researches but they are very limited. Secondly the 
visualization is informative but it cannot be easily understood and there is a 
lot  of  data,  or  the  data  being  shown  is  not  enough  or  easily  navigable,  or 
customizable to the specific science question the user has. 
 
This  project  overcomes  these  limitations  by  providing  many  of  the 
functionality  by  web  services  enabling  researchers  to  get  the  data  in  a 
standard format so they can process it further. Visualization is very different 
from  what  is  being  currently  offered  by  similar  projects.  Information 
visualization  is  not  an  easy  task,  the  challenge  is  to make  the  visualization 
informative  and  yet  easily  understood,  and  that  the  information  being 
displayed is never too much or too less.  
 
• Improved Visualization 
• Visualization based on requirements 
• Customizable Visualization 
• Many more features through web service 
 
This  differentiates  this  system  from  all  others,  it  gives  informative 
visualization  of  the  data  with  many  options  to  change,  how  the  data  is 
displayed, and that data is only shown if requested by the user. Once data has 
been requested it  is rendered to the visualization. Enabling user to view just 
the data he/she wants on the screen instead of having to search through a lot 
of information to get the information they need. 
Proposed Solution 
Information  visualization  is  very  important  in  bioinformatics  as  the  field  is 
known for its vast amount of data and the type of the data it has, as discussed 
above.  Information visualization in the field of bioinformatics has some steps 
as defined by Lang et al [29], these steps include 
 
• Data acquisition 
Web Services and Data Visualization in the Browser 
                                                       University of Bristol -??? Computer Science                               21 
• Data mapping 
• Rendering 
Data acquisition 
This  step  deals  with  acquiring  the  required  data  form  the  database  and 
processing  it  so  that  it  can be used  in  the next step. Once  the data has been 
acquired  the  data manipulation  can  begin which  focuses  on  formatting  the 
data in a format so that it can be used in data mapping. [29] 
Data mapping 
This step requires that the data retrieved from the first step is now mapped to 
shapes and their characteristics are defined such as color, size & location. In 
this step the shapes are decided in which the data is to be shown and different 
IV techniques are used for this. [29] 
Rendering 
This is the final step once data mapping has been done it is time to render this 
data to the visualization so it can be visualized on the screen and user can see 
the data. [29] 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This method works  fine  in visualizing  the data but  if  the amount of data  is 
huge than the visualization will be too big to understand and detect patterns 
for a researcher.  In  this project  the data set  that  is considered  to visualize  is 
huge, this technique needs to be altered in order to fit the scenario. 
 
Allowing user to decide how much information and what information he/she 
wants  is  the  key  to  this  project  the  technique  is  altered  so  that  the  data 
acquisition  is  repeated  when  ever  a  request  is  made  and  rendering 
accumulates everything so that as the user moves forward he/she can still go 
back in the visualization. 
 
Data  mapping  is  not  a  major  portion  as  the  visualization  that  is  being 
considered at this point is a tree where the location, color and size are already 
decided,  but  this  does  not  mean  it  has  been  removed  because  as  this 
technique will not only apply to tree but other visualizations as well.

So  this allows going  from rendering back  to data acquisition. Once  the data 
has  been  rendered,  user  can  select  any  information  he  wants  from  the 
rendered  view  a  request  is  made  for  data  acquisition  and  then  is  data  is 
mapped, finally it is rendered again on the screen but this time is altered. The 
new data is added to the already rendered data on the screen. Hence showing 
only the  information the user needs  instead of rendering all  the  information 
that  there  is,  which  makes  this  a  powerful  tool  for  visualization  in 
bioinformatics.  
 
This technique focuses on how data can be delivered and rendered and that 
the  information  shown  is  what  the  user  wants.  How  to  display  that 
information  in  a  manner  that  user  can  easily  adapt  and  understand  the 
visualization is another thing. 
 
It  is  very  important  to  know  how  the  data  will  be  displayed  what 
visualization  will  be  used  and  will  it  fulfill  the  objective.  This  is  very 
challenging as the data at hand has unique characteristics.  
 
When  implementing  the  hierarchy  of  genomes  the  best  way  to  show  such 
visualization was  to use  a  tree graph.  I  have  already discussed  some of  the 
java script libraries, which has been used in order to implement this solution. 
The  visualization  methods  used  have  been  selected  on  the  basis  on  three 
things 
 
• Gives user visualization options 
• Can be changed/altered to adapt the technique above 
• Information can be visualized clearly 
 
It  is  hard  to  measure  difference  between  visualization  for  that  purpose  a 
criteria  is  set  to  judge whether  visualization  is  informative  and  appropriate 
for the dataset being considered or not. The criterion that was considered for 
judging  visualization  has  been  discussed  above.  Much  visualization  were 
considered but rejected as they failed one or more of the things above, such as 
PlotKit, flot and Rgraph etc. These libraries did not meet the criteria discussed

above.  The  libraries  protovis,  JavaScript  InfoVis  Toolkit,  and  highcharts  all 
fulfill  the  above  criteria  and  were  considered.  The  visualizations  were 
selected after shortlisting the different visualizations that met the criteria and 
than discussing these visualization with the supervisor and advisor. The one, 
which was most suitable for viewing the type of data being considered, was 
used to ensure that the visualization is informative. 
 
The  second problem  is unavailability of data  in  a  standard  format  from  the 
SUPFERFAMILY  database.  Some  previous  approaches  have  used  different 
methods  to  solve  this  problem;  the method  I  choose  to  go  ahead with  is  to 
make web  services. Web  services  are  standard  and  are  used  in most  of  the 
tools being developed as it has many benefits. We discussed the web services 
above and to solve this problem I will use SOAP, as it is an industry standard 
and more general than RESTful. So if the system is expanded later on it will 
not be limited by the limitations of the RESTful protocol. 
Technology 
Java is my first choice of the language to use, as it is an open source language 
the  tools  available  for  it,  like  Eclipse  are  free  of  cost. Whereas  using  .NET 
would  require  that  I  have  MS  Visual  Studio  and  would  be  platform 
dependent.  As  this  project  might  be  used  in  the  university  I  have  given 
preference  to  Java so  that  it can be hosted on the university servers without 
any problems. [17] 
 
Mainly  Java,  Java  Script,  JSP  and  AJAX  have  been  used  to  implement  the 
system. AJAX has been used for retrieving the data asynchronously where as 
Java Script libraries have been used for visualization.

 System>>
 
Figure 10: Basic design of the system 
This basic diagram shows the basic structure of the system. The system have 
used  the  database  and  provided  a  WSDL  interface  on  the  Internet  and 
everyone who wants to use it can access it through the Internet. Not only the 
people wishing  to view the data but also  the people who want  to process  it 
further  can  access  the  system  and  retrieve  information  in  a  standard  form. 
The  system provides both a web  service  interface and a web page  form, on 
which the data can be viewed. 
 
This  also  allows  the  people  to  use  the  web  services  and  create  their  own 
system  using  the  data  from  the  web  service  so  different  platforms  can  be 
added as well.

Non-???functional Requirements 
 
• Available 24/7. 
• User friendly. 
• Scalable 
 
 These  non-???functional  requirements  were  considered  when  designing  and 
developing the system. These requirements will be met in different stages of 
the project some would be met in designing where as some would be met in 
implementation.

The detailed use case shows how biologist will view the data and what steps 
are used to get there. Biologist can search for which he needs to enter details. 
He/she can also select a genome or protein and view the graph. 
 
Researcher  can  receive  the data  by providing  the details  about what he/she 
wants and make that request to the web service. Web service would than send 
the required data to the researcher in a standard format.

Figure 15: Class diagram for SFD 
The  class  diagram  shows  the  implemented  classes  and  the  design  of  the 
system. Each of the modules has been implemented in a separate class having 
a separate DAO. All the DAO’s are inherited by Dbconn, which has methods 
Web Services and Data Visualization in the Browser 
                                                       University of Bristol -??? Computer Science                               28 
to connect to the database and execute queries. This allows the system to be 
expandable  later  on.  As  each  of  the  modules  are  in  a  separate  class  new 
methods and functionalities can be added without any problem. OO patterns 
were  also  considered  such  as  factory.  It  is  also  important  that  the  new 
functionalities that are added are available through web service. For this there 
is  a  service  class  that  lists  all  the  functions  currently being provided by  the 
web service. Once a new functionality is added to the system in one or more 
of the modules all the developer has to do is link those functionalities in the 
service class and that will ensure that those methods are now also available.  
 
This design maintains a low coupling between the classes and shares the data 
based on data encapsulation. This ensures that when a module is updated it 
can be easily changed and does not affect other modules, as it has less inter-???
module dependency. 
 
Some  times designing a  system can  lead  to over-???design which  is  a waste of 
time and requires more  time  in adding functionalities  to  the system as well. 
To  ensure  this  does  not  happen  I  have  used  traceability  matrix  Figure  16. 
according to the requirements of the project. Each requirement is mapped to 
the class that it is using to see whether any of the classes are useless and does 
not need to be created.

Figure 17: Sequence diagram for Statistics of genome 
Above  sequence diagram clearly  shows how  the process works,  in  this  case 
how a researcher can retrieve statistics of a genome. The researcher first calls 
the  web  service  and  gives  details  like  combination  id  and  taxonomy  the 
service  than  call  the  genomeBL  class,  which  is  the  business  logic  class. 
GenomeBL  than  calls  the  genome  class,  which  is  the  DAO.  The  genome 
requests  the  information  from  the  database  and  sends  it  back  to  the 
GenomeBL which sends it back to the service and finally to the user.

The sequence diagram above shows how children for a specific node can be

than calls the TreeBL class, which is the business logic class. TreeBL than calls 
the Tree class which acts as a DAO for Tree which gets the information from 
the database and sends it back to the TreeBL which sends is to the service and 
finally to the user.

Figure 19: System architecture diagram for SFD 
The system architecture gives detailed information about the system and how 
the  system works. The  system  is based on 5 basic  layers Data Access Layer 
that  deals  with  data  access  objects  that  retrieves  the  information  from  the 
database; Presentation Layer deals with  the display of  the data  that  is being 
retrieved  from  the  database.  Whereas  the  Web  Services  provides  a  WSDL 
interface  to  system  so  that  the  data  can  be  retrieved  in  a  form  that  can  be 
computed  easily  rather  than  just  available  through web page.  Further more 
we  have  a  Logging  Layer;  it  is  used  to  log  details.  Support  Layer  have  the 
entity classes and the framework classes these both support  the system. The 
system  architecture  has  been  designed  keeping  in  mind  the  fact  that  the 
system might be expanded in  the future,  to minimize the complexity and to

Deployment diagram shows a possible deployment for the system. It has been 
designed keeping  in mind  that  the some of  the non-???functional  requirements 
are met.  Both  the  database  server  and  hosting  server  has  a  backup  in  case 
anyone  of  the  server  goes  down.  It  is  also  necessary  to  have  mirrored 
databases.

Consider the system that is currently the development system for the project. 
For  this my  laptop  is  the  server  for  the SFD system as well  as  the database 
server.  If  my  system  crashes  I  will  not  be  able  to  access  any  of  the  web 
services.  But  let  us  assume  we  have  a  backup  but  the  database  is  not 
mirrored. So the backup started serving the requests, the information on the 
backup  database  is  out-???dated,  why?  Because  the  backup  database  was  not 
mirrored with the main server the information was never updated, hence the 
information is lost. Hence it is important to have mirrored databases.

Above  image  shows  the  ERM  diagram  of  the  database  that  the  system  is 
developed  for,  it outlines all  the  tables and  their  relations. The class choices 
that I made during the implementation were based on this model. As it has a 
Protein, Genome, Tree  table  that holds  the  respective  information about  the 
relation. The system has these classes as well, which perform the functionality 
related  to  these  tables. We  also  have  tree  graph  class  in  the  system, which 
uses  the  functionality  in  the  tree  class  and  manipulates  the  data  to  form

to  the  requirements. These  standards also ensure  that  the  system have been 
built, designed and tested properly and hence the chance of failure reduces. 
 
Testing standards are also used to document the tests done on the system the 
unit  testing  has  been  done  on  the  system  to  ensure  each  unit  of  source  is 
working  in  accordance  with  the  requirement  each  of  the  units  have  been 
tested twice to ensure system does not have a bug. Each of the units has been 
tested separately and the final testing results are shown below. 
Testing 
SFB testing activity includes following testing strategies  
Unit Testing 
• How – Make short test methods to test the code at different levels  
• When – Unit  testing was done  simultaneously with  the development 
of small units.    
• Why – To assure that all the individual units of source code are fit for 
use. 
• On What – On every individual unit of the source code  
• Test Iterations – Two Iterations

The  results  of  unit  testing  shows  that  testing  was  satisfactory  and  no 
problems were  detected  at  unit  testing  level  and  hence  the  system will  not 
face  any  problems  at  this  level.  Each  of  the  classes  have  been  tested  by 
creating  a  test  class  for  that  specific  class,  and  all  the methods  in  the  class 
were tested for problems. 
 
Different  cases  were  considered  including  null  values,  positive  values, 
negative values, and actual values. The methods were changed to ensure no 
problems  arise  in  any  of  cases.  Integration  testing  was  also  done  on  the 
system.  All  the  modules  were  tested  once  they  were  integrated  with  each 
other to form the complete system.

Data Visualization 
Data  visualization  is  the  key  in  this  project  and  the  technique  developed 
above has been used  to  implement  the  system, which allows user  to have a 
different  and more  effective method  to  visualize  large  amount  of  data.  The 
result of the implementation gives a good idea about how a user can visualize 
the data.  
 
I have  implemented  two different visualizations  to consider  the possibilities 
of  this  technique  being  applied  on  data  from  any  other  field.  The  first 
implementation  is  for  a  tree  graph.  As  the  tree  has  more  than  3000  nodes 
visualizing  it  becomes  a  problem.  Graph  implemented  focuses  on  data 
visualization and gives user the option to view the data as he desires. 
 
 
Figure 22: Tree Orientation in SFD 
To accomplish this tree orientation feature is there which allows the tree to be 
displayed  in  four  different ways,  user  can  change  the  orientation  of  tree  to 
left, top, bottom and right.

Figure  23  shows different  tree  orientations  that  a user  can  select  from. Tree 
orientation can even be done once the graph is loaded. Allowing user to view 
data in any orientation without even refreshing a page. Tree can be adjusted 
at  any  point  regardless  of  any  depth  of  the  tree  the  user  is  at.  The  nodes 
allows user to traverse through the tree. The node selected is brought to the 
center so that the user can visualize both portions of tree ahead and the point 
from where he got to the node. 
 
 
Figure 24: Results of traversing through tree 
As the technique focuses on targeting huge amount of data the graph shows 
only  the  nodes  that  have  been  requested  by  the  user.  If  the  user  reaches  a 
point where they do not see any further nodes they can select the last node to 
load  the  next  set  of  nodes.  Once  the  nodes  have  been  loaded  the  center  is 
adjusted again to node select allowing user to view the newly loaded nodes. 
This is done through AJAX so that once the user starts to visualize the data he 
does not have to refresh or reload the page. The data that is loaded aggregates 
with the already loaded graph giving user more information but still only the 
information that the user requires. So a user can move from level 1 of the tree 
to level 10 and still only see the information user wishes to. This only does not 
allow user to skip a lot of nodes that are not important for the user but also 
gives  a  lot  more  space  to  the  user  to  load  more  nodes  and  still  have  a 
visualization  which  provides  the  information  in  a  manner  that  can  be 
understood easily.

Figure 25: Results of path 
It  can  be  important  sometimes  to  know  how  you  managed  to  get  to  the 
position at which you are now in the tree, if you are 20 or more levels deep. 
This visualization keeps  track of  the your path and changes  the color of  the 
nodes  to  yellow  through which  you manage  to  get  to  the  point  you  are  at 
now. Ensuring  that you do not  loose  the way  to node at hand at  any point 
during the visualization experience provided. Even loading new nodes does 
not affect the path.

Sometimes  when  researching  it  is  required  that  you  have  a  fresh  look  at 
things, a new perspective that can enable you to consider possibilities you did

not  think of before. The visualization method  tries  to achieve  this by  letting 
the  user  select  the  root  node  if  he wishes  to.  The  actual  root  is  selected  by 
default, if the user wants to change the root node and consider looking at the 
information from a different point of view user can do so just by selecting the 
set as root option and selecting the node to convert to root. This process also 
does not  require user  to  refresh or  reload  the page  so user  can enjoy hassle 
free visualization experience. 
 
 
Figure 27: Tree implementation 
This  graphs  enables  different  and  more  efficient  method  to  visualize  huge 
amount of data. Giving user the freedom to select the data he wants view and 
as he wants to view by selecting the tree orientation, it stores the path so user 
knows how he got  to  the position even at a depth of 50  levels and finally  it 
allows user to view the data in a way he would not have before by changing 
the root node.

This  is  an  implementation  showing  results  about  a  combination  being 
repeated in different genomes. The list of genomes goes on, this is part of the 
results. Yes viewing the data in this manner gives the information clearly but 
if you want to detect patterns and unusual changes it wouldn’t be easy if the 
list were  too  long  instead having a visualization of  the data would  improve 
that. 
 
Figure 29: Result of improved visualization 
 
The  second  graph  focuses  more  how  the  data  can  be  displayed  in  a  more 
simple  visualization  yet  the  information  is  presented,  as  the  user  wants  it. 
Again the amount of data is huge and hence making a simple visualization is 
difficult  to  keep  both  the  information  and  a  good  visualization  experience. 
Above  image  shows  a  stacked  bar  chart  with  a  lot  of  information,  as  it  is 
required to compare different genomes, hence to ensure that all information is 
retrieved and  showed but  still  is  easy  to understand, many option are  their 
for user to change the information as he desires. 
 
 
 
Figure 30: Feature of improved visualization 
 
Above  image shows  that  the user can roll over at any point  in graph and  it 
shows the exact value and genome that the value is for so that the information 
can be extracted easily even if the data is a lot.

Figure 31: select/deselect genome in improved visualization 
User  also  has  the  ability  to  select/deselect  the  genomes  which  he  does  not 
want,  just by clicking at  the genomes would make them grey and removing 
the data from the chart so the user can easily sort out the genome he finds are 
not required. 
 
 
Figure 32: Feature of improved visualization 
 
Sometimes  you want  the data  and would  like  to  store  it.  The  graph has  an 
option  on  top  of  it  allowing  the  person  to  save  the  graph  as  a  PNG,  JPEG, 
SVG  vector  image  or  a  PDF  document.  Enabling  user  to  keep  the  data  for 
further research. If required the second option allows user to print the graph 
directly from the web. 
 
Graphs shown above represent the huge quantities of data, which is not only 
non-???homogenous, it also scales in a non-???linear way in places, and the relative 
importance  is  biological  and  not  numerical.  These  graphs  convey  the 
information, which would be very hard for a researcher so see if just raw data 
was provided, as just looking at numbers would not help. This graphs tries to 
achieve the concept of  ‘A picture is worth a thousand words.’ By showing a 
graph that represents such a data in a scientifically meaningful manner. 
 
The  visualizations  implemented  can  be  composed  together  so  that  the  user 
can  click on  the genome  in  the  tree visualization and be  taken  to  the graph 
comparing them. This can be  implemented  just by making a new html page 
and requesting both the services that have already been implemented.

Web Services 
These were  the results of  the data visualization part of  the system. Now we 
move on  to  the web services. Many  functions are now available on  the web 
allowing  the  user  to  get  data  in  a  standard  format.  Now  lets  consider  an 
example,  the  tree graph  that was discussed above showed some nodes with 
names  on  it  or  null.  They  all  also  have  an  id  that  can  be  used  in  a  certain 
manner  to  manipulate  the  data.  So  here  I  show  the  request  and  response 
envelope of  soap  to  the  service  if you  request  children of a  certain node.  In 
this  case  that  node  is  1.  The  method  that  we  call  from  web  service  is 
getChildrenByNodeId.

are returned.

  </soapenv:Envelope> 
Listing 9: SOAP response for child nodes 
Now as we remember all the nodes had names on them, to get the names you 
need  the  taxon  id. So  in  the response you see nodes and  taxon  ids,  for each 
node.  1684  is  first node  id,  and 2  is  the  taxon  id  for  that node,  2  is  another 
node for which taxon id is -???1. 
 
 The structure followed in the return from the function is 
 
<node id>first node<node id> 
<taxon id>taxon id for first node<taxon id> 
<node id>second node<node id> 
<taxon id>taxon id for second node<taxon id> 
 
Now  that we  have  the  node  id  and  the  taxon  id, we want  the  name  of  the 
node. For  that we again have  to call  the web service  in  this case we request 
the name of node 1 which is 1684 where taxon id is 2. The method we use for 
this is getNameByTaxonId.

The response envelope gets us the name of the node by the taxon id, here the 
name we got  is  ‘bacteria’ which  is  the name  for node 1, whose  id was 1684 
and taxon id was 2. 
 
This was a simple example that explained how a web service could be used 
for manipulating data. Now the advantages  for researchers are a  lot as  they 
can  get  statistics  of  genomes,  proteins,  complete  hierarchy  and  a  lot  more 
information in a standard form. So they can now easily use that information 
and implement their techniques on the data to process further. The method of 
screen scrapping would not be required once the web service is available.

Critical Evaluation 
This project is mostly based on data visualization and hence the best way to 
judge whether  the visualization  is better or not was  to ask people.  I  carried 
out this on a small group of people, they used the application and they were 
asked to answer a couple of questions based on the visualization. They were 
first asked to view the data using the current visualizations and/or raw data, 
and  than  asked  to  view  the  same  in  the  visualization  developed  in  this 
project.  They  were  to  judge  whether  the  data  that  is  being  displayed  is 
meaningful, and shows the information they wish to see. They were asked to 
judge  based  on  the  information  they  see  in  raw  data  and/or  in  previous 
visualization.  
 
 
Figure 33: Evaluation Results 1 
 
The result of the first question was satisfactory as most of the people thought 
the visualization was better than the viewing raw data or the current method 
of visualization. Only small portion of the people said that this was not better 
they were asked to comment on it. So I could get a better idea about why they 
did not prefer this visualization. 
 
If not please comment 
Most of the comments on this were regarding the fact that they are fine with 
current  visualizations  and would  not  like  them  to  change.  Some  comments 
show  that  they did not want any kind of  change  to visualizations. As  some 
people are not open to changes this can be reason for this as well.

Figure 34: Evaluation results 2 
 
Again the results were satisfactory as most of the people answered that they 
would  use  the  visualization  if  provided  online  whereas  a  comparatively 
smaller portion  said  they would not prefer using  this visualization  if  it was 
provided online. 
 
 
Figure 35: Evaluation Results 3 
 
The most  important  question was  to  know whether  the  graph  shows what 
needs  to  be  shown.  Students  of  computer  science  were  satisfied  with  the 
information  shown and  felt  nothing  important was  lost  if  compared  to  raw

data.  Making  this  overall  a  better  approach  than  currently  available 
approaches. 
 
After looking at all the results together, I can conclude that people do prefer 
this  system, but still  there  is  room for  improvement as some answered  they 
would  not  prefer  to  use  this  visualization  that  may  be  because  the  are 
satisfied with the current method. As the visualization is very different from 
currently implemented visualization, this can be a reason, as people generally 
do not like change. Implementing the system using the current visualization 
methods and introducing these features in those visualizations could result in 
a better system. 
 
Problems that caused the limitation 
The visualizations developed in the project are  limited but can be expanded 
using  the  technique  defined  above.  Visualizations  developed  are  limited 
because  at  first  the  requirements  given  were  ambiguous;  with  a  complex 
database  that was  so  problem  specific  that  it  required  the  advisors  domain 
knowledge  for  any  interpretation.  After  getting  to  know  the  database  and 
understanding what was  required.  I  started with designing  and developing 
the  system.  After  the  system was  designed  and  ready  to  implement  I  was 
faced  with  more  questions  requiring  domain  knowledge  of  the  advisor  to 
understand the taxonomies and types of genomes that would be searched. 
I now have the domain knowledge in the web service structure; now that the 
web  services  have  been  created  the  future  implementation  of  the 
visualizations would be simplified using this system. 
Conclusion 
The project started off with an objective at hand and an idea that needed to be 
implemented.  The  objective  to  visualize  the  data  in  a  manner  that  is 
informative  and  yet  easy  to  use  for  users  and  that  the  researchers who  are 
willing  to  perform  further  work  using  the  data  in  the  SUPERFAMILY 
database are able to do so easily, both of these objectives were met. 
 
Moreover, The objectives of visualization in bioinformatics were also met. As 
the system developed enables user to view large amount of information in a 
clear and effective manner and allows patterns and trends to be recognized, it 
even supports multiple visualization options to aid in pattern recognition. 
 
The system developed can be improved as the evaluation results suggest that 
improvements can be made and hence there  is scope for future work in this 
project.

Future Work 
Data visualization has a vast scope; it is not limited to the data considered in 
this project or even the technology. Data can be represented in a many ways. 
The way it has been represented in this project is meaningful for this type of 
data  but  the  there  are  many  possibilities.  Imagination  is  the  limit  to  data 
visualization.  If  you  can  imagine  the  data  meaningfully  you  can  try  to 
visualize  the data  in  the same manner.  It might not be possible now, due to 
limitation of the technology but it will be some day. [29] 
 
The  implementation  in  this  project  has  been  focused  on  the  data  in  the 
superfamily  database.  Further  improvements  can  be  made,  as  from  the 
evaluation we  get  a  lot more  insight  on what  could  be  a  better  system. As 
results  indicate  that  some people would prefer old visualization rather  than 
new. The system can maintain both the visualizations to rectify this problem 
or  the  old  visualization  can  be  improved  to  provide  similar  functionalities. 
Most of the people were satisfied with the fact that no information was lost in 
the  visualization  but  to  improve  3D  based  visualization  could  be  used  to 
provide more insight to the data.

User Manual 
This  manual  will  allow  researchers  to  connect  to  the  web  service,  in  this 
manual  I will  discuss  how web  service  can  be used  through  java.  It  can  be 
used on other platforms as well but  this manual will  focus on using  it with 
java.  
 
1. First step is to create a java application 
2. Import the Axis jar files available from Internet. 
3. Now to call the web service, write the code below in your method. 
 
try  
{ 
 
String endpoint ="?URL"?; 
     
Service  service = new Service(); 
Call     call    = (Call) service.createCall(); 
     
call.setTargetEndpointAddress( new java.net.URL(endpoint) ); 
call.setOperationName(new  QName("?http://soapinterop.org/"?,"?Method 
Name"?)); 
String ret = (String) call.invoke( new Object[] { Paramter 1, Parameter 2 } ); 
     
System.out.println("?Reply was '?"? + ret + "?'?"?); 
}  
catch (Exception e) 
{ 
System.err.println(e.toString()); 
} 
 
Replace URL with the URL of the service. 
Replace Method Name with the name of the method you wish to call 
Replace  Parameter  1,  Parameter  2  with  the  values  that  match  the  method       
being called. 
Ret will hold the result. 
This is a basic manual to enable the user to use the web service.

ABSTRACT 
 
As the number of images on the internet resources have grown enormously to a large 
extent in the past few years, the development of efficient techniques for the purpose of 
navigation, identifying, indexing, searching, and labeling the images has become very 
important. 
In this research, we will rely on two major resources and features for the identification of 
images, one is the image features while the other is the text based tags attached to the 
images on photo sharing sites. The image based search is done by the extraction of 
certain high and low level features from the input images and all the images in the 
database, and are compared as per the different machine learning algorithms to compute 
and show the images most nearer to the input image. Different types of features are 
extracted from the images with the help of basic image processing techniques including 
histograms, scale values, and other relevant features. The tag and text based searching is 
done by the help of comparing the tags attached to each of the images with the tags that 
are input with the help of machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to find 
out the nearest tags in the database. Certain tagged are considered noisy and are 
eradicated, the preferences and importance factors plus distance are attached with the tags, 
and the number of the tags plus the number of exactly matching or closely matching tags 
are also kept in consideration for the purpose of short listing the relatively close images. 
The project takes use of the online photo sharing resource on Flickr due to two different 
reasons. It is one of the biggest resources available with a large number of pictures, and 
some work has been done for the creation and development of third party application 
programming interfaces for the extraction and comparison of images from Flickr. This 
helps in the extraction of images on the basis of certain particular tags and saving them in 
the database so that the algorithms can all be implemented later on the information stored 
in the database. In this project, we extract around twenty thousand images from Flickr on 
the basis of four different tags, and those images along with the tags and all other relevant 
information are stored in the database. Then the certain image features of each of the 
images are extracted and are saved in the database as well for the purpose of matching 
later on. Then whenever a text or an image is entered, the database is queried on the basis 
of certain efficient and effective machine learning algorithms to find the appropriate close 
results with the help of attaching weights and distance factors which each kind of query. 
Different effective and highly researched algorithms like similar text searching, k-nearest 
neighbor, and neural networks are utilized to find out the closest matches, and then the 
closely matched images are displayed as an output to the application on an effective and 
usefully designed user interface on .Net platform.

 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background 
As the digital cameras and the use of internet technology has evolved and increased to an 
unbelievable extent in the past couple of decades in everyday use, the number of images 
available on different sources around the internet or on personal databases has grown to 
an enormous number as well. This can be understood by sighting the statistics on some of 
the famous platforms for online photo sharing. Flickr, a prominent resource and website 
for the storage of photographs (Amazon), consists of over 6 billion images (Flickr). There 
is a lot of effort and a huge amount of database servers and bandwidth required to handle 
and manage this type of excessively large databases of photo sharing, but at the same 
time there are many advantages attached to the presence of such systems with the 
availability of a very large number of pictures. These large numbers of photos available 
on the online resources leave room for many new possibilities and applications by 
investing in the field of statistical analysis, image processing, automatic model learning 
of images, and machine learning for the classification, identification, and indexing of the 
images. 
Currently the images are searched by most of the available on the basis of some tags and 
some information related to the camera and time of picture taken that is sometimes 
available with the images and sometimes not. The biggest problem associated with the 
searching of images on the online resources on the basis of tags is that many people tend 
to highlight their own opinions and interpretations while uploading or attaching tags to 
the images which introduces a need to implement proper machine learning algorithms to 
find matching texts and to get rid of the unimportant tags that are not accurately needed. 
For example, when a tag named as Christmas, is searched along the internet on the photo 
sharing sites, the most common and important output is a large number of pictures that 
have almost nothing to do with the event Christmas or its exact calibrations. At the same 
time, the kind of texts to be searched have to follow certain criteria because number of 
th
pictures can be found on the data 25 of December regarding Christmas than by the work 
Christmas itself. That is one reason that depicts accurately that the searching of the 
images solely on the basis of text tags is not enough in any way at all, and there is a need 
to make use of more than one type of features for the proper and effective searching of 
the images. 
In this particular work, the focus has been shifted from the normal implementation of 
such system solely on the basis of text to the searching with the help of a couple of 
methods i.e. text based searching from tags and image based searching for the features. A 
major effective future application of this type of project can be considered to use a 
5 
 combination of both of the methods to detect similar images on the online databases 
which can be much more effective and free of noise. 
The focus in terms of the online repository is kept on Flickr. Flickr is one of the largest 
online photos sharing websites and it contains over 3 Billion online photos shared from 
different people from all over the world. This is one of the reasons why third party APIs 
have been developed to assist in the process of searching images through Flickr on the 
bases of certain texts. The saving of images is important in the regard that they can be 
saved with all their tags on the databases that are further utilized for the purpose of 
searching and implementing machine learning algorithms. There are many other 
advantages also attached with the use of Flickr as compared to the other resources. It 
provides a huge amount of training data that is annotated, but the annotations are often 
quite noisy and unimportant, hence introducing a need to filter appropriate data. 
There are a large number of applications in which this particular research and 
implementation can help people. One of the main advantage is in the domain of tourism 
where people can upload a picture where they are and can see pictures of many related 
images to that, and they can upload the tags regarding the place they are in and can know 
about all the places that exist in the region. Apart from this basic application, it can also 
largely help in the improvement of the GPS based applications and the help of such 
applications can be taken by the investigation departments. The research also leaves a lot 
of room for further conduction of research in the field domains of image processing, 
databases, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. So this project can be taken for 
further improvements to develop very important and helpful future systems.

 1.2 Motivation 
The internet has become a repository for the collection of several important things like 
photos in the recent times. Recent estimates show that the number of online photos 
available at present is in the range of tens of billions which is actually a very huge 
amount. The largest image warehouses among the online resources are Facebook, Flickr, 
ImageShack, and several others, and while some of the platforms like Facebook give the 
option to also contain the private pictures which are not visible to the rest of the people, 
some platforms like Flickr have all of their images open to be viewed and accessed by 
anyone around the globe. The number of freely available images on Flickr ranges from 
over 3 billion pictures to 5 billion pictures in total which is actually a very huge number 
(Eric, 2009). This is the first time in the history that someone has the access to this large 
number of pictures. 
These photos that are present on these open resources are not limited to certain places, 
certain countries, or certain people, rather the pictures are available from all around the 
world. So there are pictures available from pretty much every country and every city in 
the world which makes the application of such a type of research resourceful and helpful 
for people residing in any part of the world. To highlight some of the statistics, the search 
for the city ‘Rome’ has around 2 million photos on Flickr, 3.5 million photos of Tokyo 
are available, 3 million from the city ‘Seattle’, and same is the case for almost any city 
around the globe. 
The purpose of showing the details of all of these cities, and the purpose of providing all 
of these statistics is mainly to highlight that the number of images for each and every 
location in the world is quite huge, and that is a major advantage for this particular 
project as this application can be used by anyone anywhere in the world for achieving the 
purposes of GPS as well as for the purposes of tourism.

 1.3 Scope of the research 
In this project, different web techniques are under consideration to create a local database. 
The tag clouds are used as a data source to discover the relationships between of different 
tags. GPS information, user id and image description along with tag cloud is saved in the 
database. Image recognition techniques are also focused to match user fed images with 
different images saved in the database. Flickr website will be used as the primary data 
source for all the images to be saved in the database. There are a large number of fields 
and domains involved in the conduction of the research for the topic under consideration 
and for the implementation of the project. The topic takes within itself the domains of 
image processing, machine learning, artificial intelligence as well as database 
management and web based retrieval. So, there are many different fields within the 
domain of this particular project.  
Image processing 
The field of image processing lies in the domain of signal processing in which the input 
to a system is an image on which different algorithms are applied and then the received 
output can be an image, a feature, or a set of different features. In our case, the input to 
the image processing system is an image while the output is a set of features after the 
implementation of different algorithms. 
Artificial intelligence 
Artificial intelligence is basically a field or domain in computer science that deals and 
aims at the creation of intelligent machines that can perform certain functionality after 
consideration testing. In our application, the program is designed after training and 
modifying for a large number of inputs, and now the algorithm has been developed in an 
artificially intelligent manner to handle a large number of unsupervised testing samples.  
Machine learning 
Machine learning basically lies within the domain of artificial intelligence that deals with 
the training of a set of input data for the training of the program before actually 
implementing it for the testing phase. The algorithms related to machine learning in this 
particular research topic and implementation are k-nearest neighbor, neural networks, and 
matching text finding algorithms. 
Database management 
Database management lies in the domain of computer science and software engineering 
for the purpose of maintaining data for easy and quick retrieval and updating. The data is 
kept in another program in the database with all the images, tags, and image features plus 
other relevant information, and all the algorithms are implemented with the help of 
queries to the database.

 1.4 Aim of the project 
The aim of this project is to optimize the image searching techniques based on tag 
clustering with most of the images on Flickr website. Using machine learning the 
relationship between different images can easily be furnished which can make the tag 
based search more easily and much optimized. Different machine learning approaches 
can be utilized to achieve the desired targets. On Flickr, pictures can be searched using a 
keyword. The resultant picture contains lots of other information other than the tags e.g. 
location information, user who uploaded the image and text describing the image in a few 
sentences. The project also aims to develop relationships between images using basic 
digital image processing techniques on the images collected from the Flickr website.

 2 BACKGROUND 
2.1 Introduction 
The purpose of this chapter is to review the work and research done previously on the 
related topic by other people. Different data and information on the implementation of tag 
based image search algorithms and their optimization is studied in this chapter. The 
purpose of the literature review is to gain in depth knowledge about the topic before 
actually designing the implementation of the project. All related previous data is studied 
in this chapter and no analysis or views are given on the research in this chapter. 
2.2 Flickr 
Flickr is one the most popular online repository of images where people can upload 
pictures which can be viewed by anyone on the website based on the related search. The 
Flickr website asks the users to add related keywords while uploading an image to the 
website. The keywords must be such that the images can easily be recognized by the 
keywords. Although there is no limitation on the tags quality and quantity but Flickr 
encourages their users to add as many keywords that can be related to image while they 
are uploading an image, adding unrelated tags to the website with an image can only 
increase the load of data on the website server and cannot be used effectively by the 
website. Flickr does not limit their users to add only a specific set of images but the 
images can be about a place, person, event, people and the images can also be the 
personal pictures of the users uploading the images on Flickr website. Today, Flickr 
contains more than 6 billion pictures on their website.

 patterns and folksonomy completely relies on the tags describing the relative data. 
Folksonomy is a classification system which is derived from collaborative tagging and 
categorizing different tags. In sharing prospects on the internet on websites there are 
usually two stakeholders involved. One is generally referred as the producer who is 
actually uploading information on the internet and then there are the consumers who are 
utilizing that information for the desired purpose. The producer plays an active role 
which sends the resources to the users according to their requirements and preferences 
gathered generally from the user browsing history. All the resources available on the 
internet are generally categorized with tags. Some visual technique such tag clouds, 
recommended list can be used to assist the producers. The producer can publish resources 
via different web sharing methods like sharing of pictures or sharing of text or documents. 
Information retrieval  is that users actively search for the resources by mentioning 
different tags related to their requirements. The consumers can find results which match 
their requirements based on the tags provided by the user. The tags searched by the user 
can also give suggestions for a future tagging process to the producers. Thus users 
contribute resources to the website which makes the website to act as the producer but 
websites are controlled by other people and resources are always from other people 
making websites only a medium to provide a platform for the whole sharing process. 
Tags are usually a short text that depicts the content of the picture. For one picture, there 
could be multiple tags associated with. Based on the information provided by tag itself, 
there are two categories of tags. A good tag is a tag which defines a unique, specific and 
accurate description to one aspect of the picture. There is no ambiguity of this tag. A bad 
tag is a tag provides less information about the picture. It could be a common word, 
unrelated description or even misleading. A good tag can reduce the search time and 
provides an accurate description of the picture. We need to reduce the number of tags 
which cost more time to discover and recognise. 
The nature of tagging system allows user to choose arbitrary words for their resources. 
However, if the user lacks of related knowledge of the resources, they may not choose the 
accurate vocabulary to describe the resources. The predefined taxonomic structure for the 
concept of resource may not be popular amongst all the users who can tag the resource. 
For example, a picture which depicts the Big Ben could be tagged with Bell Tower, tall 
building, building in London or landmark of Westminster. The tags are not the accurate 
description for the picture, thus it causes the trouble for tagging system.  
The result of unaware tagging, that is, the tags which are redundant, inaccurate, mistake, 
is undesirable for tagging system. The disagreement of vocabulary of the tags will 
introduce the inefficiency of the tagging system. The user interaction of the same 
resource is also affected.

 web pages. The social networking study is focusing on the relationship between the users. 
It is helpful to apply the measurement development in social networking to tagging 
system. If all the tags that are used to tag the pictures, the users may not continue to add 
the synonyms of available tags to a specific picture. In some applications, the users are 
not aware of the tags created by another user. The chance of appearance of redundant tags 
can increase greatly. The links between the users are crucial to social network. However, 
the influence of functions of social network may make the tags system in picture sharing 
easier. The users may provide some synonyms of the tags that could provide us clue of 
the relationship between the tags. In this scenario, the tags are actually bond to the 
resources. The resource became the bridge of the tags which are describing the attribute 
of the resource. We can connect all the tags which may share the same meanings to a 
certain resource. Taxonomies for tagging in social sharing network may be categorized 
into two basic things. These factors involved in the social tagging system may be the 
producers or the consumer. The producer plays the role of controlling the tags about a 
certain resource. The methods of distributing the tags many restrict the availability of 
information. The users or consumers can promote the selection of both resources and tags. 
The contribution of the users is the source of the tags. If we provide enough incentives, 
the users are willing to provide enough tags for the resources. The user assistant functions 
are one form of incentives. The difficulties in tagging system, as pointed out by Golder 
and Huberman (2007) is two aspects of semantics. The poly-semi is one single word but 
it can have multiple meanings. The same word with different meanings is very hard to 
detect. Supplied by a dictionary, the word with different meanings can be detected. 
However, it is difficult to select the correct meaning for the word. In some occasions, the 
word can be used for multiple meaning at the same time. The synonymy is multiple 
words having the same meaning. The synonymy is relatively easy to detect and tackle. In 
addition, the ontology of word that the various level of abstraction of the word in the 
same tag list can be difficult to recognize and categorize. According to Marlow (2006), 
the tagging system can reduce any number of tags into two-dimensional taxonomy. The 
dimension of taxonomy is the way to study a snapshot of tagging system. The first 
dimension includes two aspects, tag creator and resource creator. The second dimension 
is based on the aspects of first dimension.  
2.3.2 Taxonomy Factors 
The factors that can improve the quality of tags and the complete tagging system can be 
categorized as taxonomy factors. To enhance the functionality of tagging system there 
must be some rules and regulations for both the producer and the users or consumers. 
Both the producer and the consumers have some responsibilities to make the system more 
effective.  
The shared tags are a tool to attract users to browse the resources which have the same or 
similar tags. To view those related tags, or explore the related content via tag clouds, user 
can engage the activities for play or compete with the counterparts. The incentive within 
those social activities provides user a way to present and express their identity. For 
example, the users can express their habit, personality, preference or track of life by 
publishing and tagging their resources on the online service. This is the incentives and 
motivations based on the human nature. The basic incentives and motivation embedded in 
the nature of online service is to provide sharing services for users to easily organize and 
15 
 publish their resources. The two motivations, organizational and social, are the basics 
amongst all the motivations. These incentives and motivation drive the users to tag the 
resources.  
These taxonomies as mentioned by Trattner, Korner and Helic (2007) are as follows, 
producers must have to follow the following basic rules which may include access to tags 
is a restriction on what user can see about tags. There are two modes for users to access 
the tags. As in dimension, the users can either have full access to the others’ tag or simply 
partial access. There are some existing models adopted by online service. Technorati.com 
a famous technology blog allows users only to tag the resource of their creation. Yahoo 
allows users tag any resources, but allow no one remove the tags. Granting users have 
more access to tags could reduce the noise in the tags list of resources. Tag hint is a 
method to provide supplement information to assist users pick up a tag. The tag hint is 
not always available in online service. Yahoo provides the tag hint system as a viewing 
existing tags and suggestion list. Delicious bookmark did not provide tag hint. In tagging 
hint system, usually users can select from a set of relevance tags according to the existing 
set of tags. The hint may also be extracted from the contextual metadata, the extension of 
the existing tags based on recommendation list, or the tags from similar pictures. The 
multiple hints guide the users to pick up the tags which are convergence in folksonomy.  
However, the suggestion of tags for a certain resource could promote a certain tag 
unfairly. The most popular tag is the one most users select. There is a chance that a tag is 
overweighed. Connectivity of resource is the internal graph represents the relationship 
between the resources. The organization paradigm of the resources can affect the tagging 
system as well. For example, in Flickr, the pictures can be grouped under a certain group. 
The group is an important factors that affecting the tags. If the group is the name of a 
place, we have valuable implications for the tags which attached the pictures within the 
group. Connectivity of User can be useful to discover the connectivity of the resources. 
The social connectivity can be a factor for statistics for calculating usage of the tag hint.  
The responsibilities of the consumers may include many of responsibilities like marking 
the resources storage which is provided by many of the websites. Mark the resource as 
potential member of a cluster or group is helpful for reminder to users. Users can take 
advantage of the benefits of the reminder function. This storage assistance can be used 
for the resources that associated with no metadata. Social Features involve multiple user 
take activities on the same resource. The activities include sharing, competition, and 
attraction for unknown. The users can also comment to express their options. The shared 
tags are a tool to attract users to browse the resources which have the same or similar 
tags. To view those related tags, or explore the related content via tag clouds, user can 
engage the activities for play or compete with the counterparts. The incentive within 
those social activities provides user a way to present and express their identity. 
 For example, the users can express their habit, personality, preference or track of life by 
publishing and tagging their resources on the online service. This is the incentives and 
motivations based on the human nature. The basic incentives and motivation embedded 
in the nature of online service is to provide sharing services for users to easily organize 
and publish their resources. The two motivations, organizational and social, are the

2.3.4 Tags on Flickr 
Tags on Flickr are all user generated. Tags are a powerful and useful feature in many 
social media and Web applications. By using tags, the user can mark the pictures on the 
web the use of tags is widespread in other resources on the web e.g. the blog, bookmarks 
and video. Comparing to ontology system of categorizing resources, tags are free-style, 
no hierarchy in the organization. All tags are in the same position for marking the aspects 
of content of pictures. It eliminated the structure which is demanded in ontology and 
categorization. As a result, tags are easier to pick than categories from ontology. Due to 
its flexibility, tags are also evolving to reflect emergent properties of their referents as 
mentioned by Golders and Huberman (2006). Tags, which lack of priori structure 
information, contain less semantic meanings. To achieve the same usable result as 
categories, which are defined based on ontology and semantics; we need to discover the 
structured information from the tag-based system.  
The geo-referenced tags on Flickr often contain the tags of the names of places and 
general location. The semantic analysis on place names to cluster the pictures which 
share the common word of places. By definition, the place semantics indicates the geo-
locations and tags are strongly associated. The mapping from tags to geo-locations is the 
pattern that can easily be discovered. In place semantics, the definition of tags i.e. it can 
be used as a powerful data source. Pictures are defined as (id, user, latitude, longitude, 
description, location, web address etc).  
2.3.5 Getting information from tags 
Different sort of information can be gathered for tags using many of techniques currently 
available. These techniques may include the following:  
Semantic analysis 
To cluster tags based on their geo-location implications by intuition, for one geo location, 
the place/location tags will burst, that is, a certain number of the tags with the same name 
cluster in that region. This is the principle of discovering the tags for the certain region. 
Secondly the region with certain of characteristics often has a boundary. Either one 
characteristic can be extended to the regions nearby, or the characteristics diminished to a 
certain boundary. For one characteristic, the region which has these characteristics may 
not overlap. For example, the income distribution is different than disease distribution in 
a certain region. The last problem is to discover the correlation of the regions. Many 
18 
 regions of one common characteristic could be neighbors in one area. We can use 
correlation tool to integrate small regions to a large one.  In addition, another aspect of 
semantic analysis on tags is about the culture localization. Some places, like art or 
museum is more correlated to a place instead of an abstract word. In order to identify 
which semantic meaning of a tag could be used as place/location, or first-order 
phenomena. We consider the tags only for its meaning in general for simplicity. For one 
certain region, the frequency of tags appearance in the tag list of a picture can be detected 
by algorithm burst-detection introduced in signal processing. The rationale behind this 
assumption is the consistence between semantic meaning and spatial region area. In a 
certain region, people tend to describe the region by the similar words. It is like the high 
peak of a probability distribution. Time-series analysis technique is applicable to spatial 
area analysis as well. The general idea behind the common time-series analysis algorithm 
such as ARIMA which was presented by Box and Jenkins (1976) and McDowall (1980) 
can detect the burst not only in temporal domain but also in spatial domain.  The results 
of spatial analysis are sensitive to the definition of spatial unit. To reduce the influence of 
distributed data in spatial dataset, it is common to normalize the dataset, making to 
related to population or population density. Thus, the result of spatial analysis is 
equalized with the variables, and it can be used more accurately. 
2.3.6 Tag mapping method 
The tag mapping method is specialized in identifying tags for the geo-location region 
automatically. Ideally, the tag mapping method will search for the tags that are uniquely 
define the geo-location region. For example, the tag mapping method can easily give the 
high score for the tags such as Big Ben, London or The London Eye. These unique names 
are the first choice of tag mapping method. The assumption of this method is that the 
unique name only specifies one place in all places all the time. The places which are 
different from current place must be named differently. The tag mapping method can 
learn the spatial region from the data, which is very different from the burst detection 
methods such as native scan and spatial scan. Due to the learning nature of tag mapping 
method some other ways must be found to define the scale and partition for the whole 
spatial domain. The burst detection methods demand the explicit ways to find the scale 
and partition for the spatial domain. The tag mapping method can learn the parameters of 
scale and partition from the picture data by cluster procedure. If the result of cluster is 
very small, the scale and partition is relative larger. The first step is to find the parameters 
of scale and partition. We can apply the common machine learning algorithm to find the 
parameters for one dataset. For scale parameter, we use the number of clusters generated 
from the photo data.  
2.3.7 Scale-Structure Identification Method 
Comparing to tag mapping method, the Scale-Structure Identification Method use the 
similar process to perform the significance test. The difference in scale-structure 
identification method the cluster is not used by its total number in a certain region, but the 
minimum spatial distance between clusters. 
We make the assumption for place tags as follows: the spatial usage distribution of a 
place tag should be the same in a cluster for all the scales. The method of cluster the tags 
19 
 are proximity-based. For most of the scales the cluster is all the points within a certain 
region of neighborhood could be merged before points are parted. The calculation of the 
distance occurs after the points are merged. We define a threshold for merging method. 
The tags can be measure differently in different types of threshold. There are three types 
of variation in measurements. Measurements on accumulation of scale, in this method the 
measurement is calculated by sum of a list of sample of scales chosen from exponential 
sample method. The tag is place tag if the summed value is lower than the threshold. The 
value is entropy, thus we select the value which is lower than threshold. The lower 
entropy is more concentrated distribution for the tags. The strength of this measurement 
is to weight the scales. We can include multiple scales for the tags. Measurements on 
occurrence of scale, the stable values from a set of calculation based on multiple scales 
can be calculated. The qualifier stable is a standard to choose the scale from the set of all 
scales. If the value is l0% more than any points of scale, the tag can be classified as place 
tag. This method is based on the attribute of the cluster. That is the occurrence of the core 
set of tags tends to be a single cluster, which is stable and distinct to the other clusters. 
The tags other than place tags almost have the multiple strong clusters. If we merge all of 
these clusters, the final threshold computed should be larger than the first method. 
· Measurement on accumulation of scale. In this method the measurement is calculated 
by sum of a list of sample of scales chosen from exponential sample method. The tag 
is place tag if the summed value is lower than the threshold. The value is entropy, 
thus we select the value which is lower than threshold. The lower entropy is more 
concentrated distribution for the tags. The strength of this measurement is to weight 
the scales. We can include multiple scales for the tags. 
· Measurement on occurrence of scale. We find the stable values from a set of 
calculation based on multiple scales. The qualifier stable is a standard to choose the 
scale from the set of all scales. If the value is l0% more than any points of scale, the 
tag can be classified as place tag. This method is based on the attribute of the cluster. 
That is the occurrence of the core set of tags tends to be a single cluster, which is 
stable and distinct to the other clusters. The tags other than place tags almost have 
the multiple strong clusters. If we merge all of these clusters, the final threshold 
computed should be larger than the first method. 
We also need the alternation in the significant test. Like the first method, we select 
the tags which are lower than a threshold. We can also include multiple scales for the 
tags. 
· Measurement Mixed. We combine the previous two methods as this method of 
measurement. Entropy we calculated after the sampling of the scales is the value we 
need to tell if the tags are a place tag or not. The set of the scales should be ordered 
in this scenario. In this method, the entropy should be close to zero, if the spatial 
distribution of the tags is more like a strong single cluster. Hence, the tags we are 
looking for, which are a small set of the tags, should have a smaller value computed 
than the tags which are not about describing a place or location. Similarly, the tags 
which have computed value smaller than the threshold are considered to be the place 
tags. We select those tags to mark the picture to be a spatial region, which is also 
discovered by the measurement methods.

2.4 Databases 
Database management lies in the domain of computer science and software engineering 
for the purpose of maintaining data for easy and quick retrieval and updating. The data is 
kept in another program in the database with all the images, tags, and image features plus 
other relevant information, and all the algorithms are implemented with the help of 
queries to the database. There are many databases for image recognitions. The database 
often store geo-information as well. The GPS coordinates because the key to search for 
image in database therefore. In geo-database, we have many forms of geographic 
information available to search. In those databases, there are some key databases that 
support geo-location very well. Point of Interest (POI) geographical database provide 
geographic knowledge to image recognitions. It helps to train the machine learning 
algorithm for specific image which is for POI. Usually the POI image associates with an 
official name, geo-location information and demographic information. Querying a POI 
database, the accuracy of tagging system can be improved as well. However, POI 
database is relative small. Many pictures are not taken in POI. The POI database may not 
contain the sub region in the POI. So POI database is very limited in image recognition. 
Aerial image database provides the overlook of a certain place. The usage of aerial image 
is popular in Google Earth and Bing Bird's Eye. The important of aerial image database is 
that it provides the local environment of a certain place. We can learn the neighborhood 
of the places we are about to learn. Plus, the street view of Google maps is another source 
to learn the details of a place. However, the aerial image often covers a large area, which 
is not suitable for a specific location. For the places that are on the ground, the aerial 
image provides little clue to recognize the picture. The aerial image is only for study the 
environment of a large area. Existing pictures on the web can also be taken as a database 
of images and can be used for image recognition. Recently the usage of tagging system 
and picture sharing service is booming on the web. According to the existing web 
resources, it is easy to match a new picture to an existing one. The tagging system helps 
21 
 people to mark a meaningful location to the picture, so matching picture will help us to 
discover the potential meaning of the picture as well.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.5 Metadata 
Metadata is a file with every picture containing basic information like the date and time at 
which the picture was taken, or with which camera the picture was taken at what 
resolution etc. The metadata of the pictures is valuable data for tagging process. The 
metadata for geo-location includes the GPS location (latitude and longitude) and heading 
information. The metadata is not limited to the information stored in the header of the 
image file. Some online service such as Flickr provides the service for users to pick up 
the geo-location where the pictures are taken. We can treat the information from third 
parties as the single data source for the geo-location for the pictures. There are two 
common schemas for storing geo information within an image file. RDF translation of the 
EXIF standard according to W3C-Exif (2003) contains the heading information and 
camera related data. It is a standard format stores the latitude and longitude. Dublin Core 
as presented in DCMI (2006) serves as the same as Basic Geo Vocabulary. In Dublin 
Core, the location context is expressed in label coverage. The location context is plain 
text composed of spatial location. For the common use, the location context is the postal 
address drilled down to the town name.

2.6 Geo-tagging 
Flickr, the most popular photo sharing online service, added the functionality to allow 
users to geo-tagging to their picture. Usually a picture was taken at a time and a location. 
Tagging a picture with its location has a great value to photo sharing, business and social 
communication. With geo-tagging enabled, the entire picture can be connected in a way 
that everyone can easily browse and search for the view of a special physical location. 
Users are also benefit from discover related service, news and other resource more easily. 
The business can find better business opportunity by providing service based on location-
aware technology. It is a great improvement to daily life that people can know a location 
better without even explores the location in person. Flickr provides users a service to 
tagging their own picture. From this abundant data of picture, we can associate the place 
and locations via the tagging relationship. The places share the common characteristics 
often are tagged with the same or similar text. The text-based (or tag-based) search is 
easy for the data mining process. Currently the commercial search engine and web photo 
services rely on the text mining, which is to associate the tags with images for better 
indexing and retrieval. The semantic analysis used in tag library helps to discover the 
relations between tags that are not explicit.

 digital image processing have their own purposes and can be utilized for different 
purposes. 
2.7.1 Image filtering 
Often the images acquired from camera or other imaging devices are not in the form that 
they can be used directly for the intended purposes. There may be many factors involved 
which can cause distortion in the process. These causes may be because of the variations 
in lightning or lamination while taking the pictures or different intensity levels in the 
picture. So, images during the process of capturing or during the analog to digital 
conversion of images processes should be used to make the images better and optimized 
for the intended use. Such process in digital image processing is known as the filtering 
process or image filtering as mentioned by Gonzalez and Wood (2002). There are 
different types of filters which are used extensively in the filtering process these are low 
pass filtering and high pass filtering. Low pass filtering only allows the low frequencies 
to pass through them and blocks the high frequency content of the image. These types of 
filters are commonly used in image averaging and to find the median of the images. 
These filters are used to reduce noise in the image and to enhance the quality of image 
removing extra pixel information from the image according to Maclean and Jernigan 
(1988). These filters can sometime blur the image depending on the fidelity of the 
original image. 
2.7.2 High Pass Imaging Filters 
High pass filters are the filters which allow only the high frequency content of the image 
to pass through them and it block the low frequency pixel value to pass through. The 
most important use of high pass filter includes edge detection or sharpening of the image. 
High pass filters can be modeled using first order derivatives or the second order 
differential equations. Filters are always implemented on an image by selecting a small 
part of the image also referred as a grid and then a matrix of same dimensions is designed 
contained the filter values. The filter matrix is then convoluted with the image grid or 
sub-spatial matrix of the image according to Schaar and Hanno (2007).  Sobel and 
Laplace are the most commonly used high pass filter to detect edges from images. 
Sobel Operator: 
Sobel operator or Sobel filter is most commonly used in digital image processing 
especially in edge detection algorithms. It actually calculates the gradient of the image 
intensity or the gradient vector at each point of the image. The Sobel filter is usually 
implemented by convolving two small filters and separable filters with the image both in 
vertical and horizontal directions. Sobel operator consumes a lot of computation power as 
it moves both in the vertical and horizontal positions according to Kroon (2009). The 
Sobel operator consists of two different small sized kernels or matrix to be convolved 
with the image grid. As a result of the convolution both the horizontal and vertical 
approximations for the derivatives is calculated as mentioned by Hanno and Schaar 
(2007). Sobel operator can be calculated by defining a matrix value such as if we 
consider A in the following formula as the source image grid and Gx and Gy as the two 
sobel kernels then the convolution will take place as follows:

 by using a filter which calculates the intensities both in vertical and horizontal locations. 
The gradient is given by the direction from that given point to the largest intensity pixel 
in its neighbors and magnitude of the vector gives the rate of change in intensities from 
one pixel to another. The intensities of pixels are unique to their discrete points and there 
is no continuous relationship necessary between the intensities at different pixel locations. 
Because of this nature of digital images simply taking derivative of the intensity function 
may not help in the calculation of the gradient of digital image. Sobel operate is 
commonly used to calculate the vector and the magnitude of the gradient of digital image. 
Although the Sobel operator is not very accurate but it can provide sufficient information 
about the direction and rate of change in the gradient of any given digital image. Sobel 
operator uses a 3x3 grid thus the gradient is calculated only in 3x3 sub spatial grids from 
an image. Gradient of an image plays an important role in many of the image processing 
concepts and it is more commonly known in the edge detection algorithms. Many 
different types of approximations and calculations of an image can be done using the 
information provided by gradient calculations.

 3 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY  
3.1 Introduction 
This chapter includes explanation of different methods and techniques used to design the 
desktop application. The application design contains concepts from different fields of 
computer and software engineering. The main fields of interest for the application design 
are as follows 
Image processing 
The field of image processing lies in the domain of signals processing in which the input 
to a system is an image on which different algorithms are applied and then the received 
output can be an image, a feature, or a set of different features. In our case, the input to 
the image processing system is an image while the output is a set of features after the 
implementation of different algorithms. 
Artificial intelligence 
Artificial intelligence is basically a field or domain in computer science that deals and 
aims at the creation of intelligent machines that can perform certain functionality after 
consideration testing. In our application, the program is designed after training and 
modifying for a large number of inputs, and now the algorithm has been developed in an 
artificially intelligent manner to handle a large number of unsupervised testing samples.  
Machine learning 
Machine learning basically lies within the domain of artificial intelligence that deals with 
the training of a set of input data for the training of the program before actually 
implementing it for the testing phase. The algorithms related to machine learning in this 
particular research topic and implementation are k-nearest neighbor, neural networks, and 
matching text finding algorithms. 
Database management 
Database management lies in the domain of computer science and software engineering 
for the purpose of maintaining data for easy and quick retrieval and updating. The data is 
kept in another program in the database with all the images, tags, and image features plus 
other relevant information, and all the algorithms are implemented with the help of 
queries to the database. 
 
 
29 
 3.2 Tools required  
The application design will be implemented using Microsoft C++ .net framework to 
design the interface for the application. Microsoft access will be used as the primary 
database management system and SQL queries will be used for communication between 
the application and the database. 
3.2.1 Microsoft Visual Studio  
Microsoft Visual Studio is development tool or to be more specific it is an integrated 
development tool from Microsoft which can be used to develop many of the console or 
desktop applications with graphical user interfaces. Microsoft Visual Studio includes 
many programming languages like C#, C++ and VB.NET. .net framework is the primary 
framework used for all the languages supported in the Visual Studio. 
The .NET Framework is an integrated Windows component for the development and 
application of the next generation applications and XML Internet services, which 
includes two main components – the common language runtime and the .NET 
Framework class library. The .NET Framework basically works on the common language 
runtime. Runtime managing codes at execution time offers some primary services such as 
thread and memory management along with the promoted robustness and security. The 
class library of .NET Framework is an object – oriented collection of reuse types, which 
support the development of various applications including classical command-line or 
graphical user interface applications, and also the latest applications based on ASP.NET 
such as web Forms and XML Web services. 
3.2.2 Microsoft Access 
Office Access or Microsoft Access is a well known database management system 
(DBMS) manufactured by Microsoft. Access is a member of the complete Microsoft 
Office Suite package. Relational databases can be created using Microsoft Access, 
although it stores data in its own format which is based on the Microsoft Jet Database 
Engine. Access can also integrate data with other Microsoft products like Excel or Word. 
Microsoft Access can communicate with .net developed applications using OLEDB data 
library provide in the .net framework.

 4 APPLICATION DESIGN 
4.1 Introduction 
The application is designed in C++ using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 (dot Net 
framework version 4).  The database to store image URLs is designed in Microsoft 
Access. There is no need to install any SQL server but Microsoft Access later than the 
2003 version must be installed on the computer in order to view and manipulate the 
database. There are two different forms designed in the application, one form is used to 
provide interface to search images from the database and the other form searches images 
directly from Flickr. There must be an active internet connection available to run the 
application, the database search form also uses internet to display the searched images 
using the Flickr URL saved in the database. 
4.2 Flickr API 
The first and foremost requirement of the application is to gather data to create a database. 
Collection of images was chosen to be done from Flickr website keeping in mind the 
popularity and number of images available on Flickr website. Flickr provides much 
information with the found images, as discussed in the literature review that Flickr 
encourages its users to add a little description and a set of tags with the images they 
upload to the website. This makes Flickr a complete source of all the information that can 
be related with an image. With all the popularity unfortunately Flickr does not provide 
any application or an application programming interface (API) for .net framework. An 
API contains functions and features that can be used by other development tools to 
integrate applications with Flickr website to get information about the images stored on 
the Flickr website or the Flickr repository. For machine learning of the application, the 
application requires at least 10000 or more pictures in the local database. Collecting 
information from images manually and feeding them to the database one by one is not 
feasible and it required a lot of time just to complete the database. Flickr API or the 
Flickr.Net library is used in the application for the purpose. Flickr.Net library is an open 
source or free licensee library available which can collect data from the Flickr website. 
Use of Flickr.Net library to communicate with Flickr website violates no copyrights as 
Flickr does not prohibit the use of such libraries to communicate with Flickr website 
through an application. The Flickr.Net library is completely written in C# .net framework 
environment and can be accessed from .net framework 2.0 or above. The following 
functions from the Flickr.Net are used in the application.    
#using <FlickrNet.dll> 
private: Flickr ^ f; 
31 
 private: PhotoSearchOptions^ o; 
private: PhotoCollection^ phCl; 
o->Extras = PhotoSearchExtras::OriginalUrl | 
PhotoSearchExtras::OwnerName | PhotoSearchExtras::Description | 
PhotoSearchExtras::Tags | PhotoSearchExtras::Geo; 
 
The above code to interface with the Flickr website will return images based on tags 
entered by the user in application interface. The information which will returned by the 
Flickr website will contain URL of the image, the name of the user who uploaded the 
image, description associated with the image, latitude and longitude of the images and 
complete set of tags that are linked with the image. 
 
 
 
 
4.3 Image processing library 
Microsoft .net framework does not offer built-in functionalities to perform basic image 
processing techniques like image resizing or applying filter to the source image. An open 
source .net framework library AForge.net is used to perform image processing techniques 
in this project. AForge.net is a library available for .net framework with free licence thus 
no copyrights have been violated while using the library. The library defines many math 
functions that can directly be applied on the images. The library also comes with certain 
image filters both high pass or low pass filters and can directly be applied to the image. 
There are other techniques available and image processing can also be done manually 
using basic .net framework functions but that results in a slow process and AForge.net 
library is optimized specially for the image processing algorithms thus performs the 
calculation at much greater speed and reliability.

Figure 5. Database Design 
33 
 Database contains five tables out of which four of the tables are connected with a central 
table while the other table is used for calculations done in the application. The Flickr 
table contains information about the image, it contains ID as the primary key for the table 
and thus ID is unique for all the records saved in the application. SRESULT table is used 
to save calculated distance of searched images using machine learning and artificial 
techniques in the application, all the results are saved in this table and final pictures are 
shown where the distance of images is closest to the searched image. All three other 
tables i.e. CURRENT IM PROCESS, IM PROCESS, CURRENT IMAGE DISTANCE 
are used for image recognition part of the application. Current IM PROCESS contains 
information about images already stored in the database in the Flickr table and this 
information contains results after image processing on the database images.

 4.5 Tag search distance calculation  
When a user enters a tag or a collection of tags, the application searches through all the 
images in the database and a distance is assigned to each of the found image. The 
distance calculation is based on the tag difference between the entered tags and the total 
number of tags associated with images in the database. The other important factor in the 
distance calculation is the number of found tags in the tag cloud of the images stored in 
the application. When a user enters a tag or a combination of tags to search in the 
database, the application searches the results in four steps as follows? 
1. The application searches all the tags in the database and get results where all the 
tags are matched in the database e.g. The user entered Pisa, tower, Italy in the  
search text box, the application searches for images in the database where all three 
entered tags are found in the tag cloud of an image stored in the database. The 
value of 2 is given to such images, this value is chosen arbitrarily and shows that 
all the images found containing all the entered tags in its tag cloud.  
2. The application then repeats the above step but this time searches for images 
containing any 2 tags from the entered combination in the image tag cloud. It only 
searches for images not found in the first step. The application assigns an arbitrary 
value of 4 for these images. 
3. The application then repeats the above step but now searches for images where 
only 1 tag is found in the tag cloud. An arbitrary value of 6 is given to these 
images. Showing that these images have the least chances to be close to the 
desired search tags. 
4. After this, the application calculates the total number of tags associated with the 
images found from the above three steps. Tag difference is calculated which is the 
total number of tags in the tag cloud of an image – the number of tags entered in 
the search text box. Maximum score chosen is 10 out of which up to 6 have 
already been assigned in the above three steps. The maximum tag difference 
found is then selected and stored in a variable, this is done to normalize the next 
calculations. The remaining score out of 4 is then calculated using the found tag 
differences as follows,  
(Current_tag_differences_from_found_image * 
4)/(Maximum_tag_difference) 
This returns a value between 0 and 4. This value is then added to the score 
assigned in previous three steps. The resultant value is considered as the distance 
of the resultant image from the searched tags between 0 and 10. The distance 
values close to 0, or lower distance value means that the image is more close to 
the desired image on the basis of tags entered.  
 
35 
 The application searches the entered tags in these steps, first step results the images 
where all the tags are found in the tag cloud of an image in the local database. This means 
that images containing all the entered tags in its tag cloud are shown as a result of this 
query. A minimum grade is given to these images which mean that it is most probable 
that the resultant images are nearest to the entered tags. ID of all the resultant images is 
stored in the database with a calculation on tag difference between the entered tags and 
the tags associated with the found image. The second part of calculation uses tag 
difference as the criteria to assign distance to the image e.g. if user entered three tags and 
all of the three tags are found in an image which contains 10 tags in its tag cloud. Another 
image is found which matches all the three tags out of 5 total tags in its tag cloud then the 
chances that the second image is more relevant to the desired output image are higher 
than the chances of first image being close to desired output. Once the calculation is done 
and all the information is saved in the application, second step of the search is performed. 
The application then searches the tags in pairs and checks the results already stored after 
the previous step. Only the results which are not already present in the database 
SRESULT table are stored in the database. The same method of distance calculation is 
applied to the results of this query and the results with assigned distance are stored in the 
database. Third step searches the least related images and images where only a single tag 
is found in the application database are displayed to the user with maximum distance 
from the searched images. A single found tag means that if a user enters three tags and 
any one of the tags is found in the images stored in the database, the application performs 
calculations on these resultant images but this step provides least relevant images with 
maximum distance from the desired image on the basis of entered tags. The following 
lines of code calculate and assign the distance to the resultant images: 
  for (int j=0; j <dataGridView1->Rows->Count-1; j++) 
   { 
    textBox2->Text += dataGridView1->Rows[j]->Cells[1]-
>Value->ToString(); 
    int  ^ td =  0; 
    td = (int) (dataGridView1->Rows[j]->Cells[1]->Value) - 
strarray->Length;

4.6 Image Based Search 
The application not only allows the user to search images from the database on the basis 
of tags only but a user can input an image and related images are found in the database 
using basic image processing techniques. AForge.Net library is used to implement basic 
image processing techniques in the application. When image information is fetched from 
the Flickr website and stored in the application some image properties are also saved in 
the application database in the IMPROCESS table. Text based image retrieval is most 
commonly used search method to search related images for a database. Text based 
images means that when a user enters an image to be searched the algorithm tries to 
automatically annotate the input image and find related images on the basis of tags. 
Automatic annotation of images is not yet designed to be very effective and such 
algorithms always work under human supervision in a semi-automatic mechanism i.e. 
user selects the correct annotations for the image or sometimes user has to provide some 
tags along with the image to be searched. The text based search is a fast mechanism but 
most of the image database around the world stores manual keywords which are not 
much reliable and annotating all the images available itself is time consuming and 
feasibility expensive task to perform. There are other methods that can also be utilized for 
the purpose like pattern matching by digital image processing techniques but that too is 
computationally expensive and it is nearly impossible to search a large database of 
images each time when a user enters an image to be searched. This application performs 
digital image processing on images at the time of entering images in the database and 
stores the calculation results about the image in a separate table linking with the main 
repository table by a unique primary key. Standard deviation and mean of an image can 
provide very useful information about the image like contrast of the image and 
information about distribution of the all the basic colors i.e. red, green and blue in an 
image. Standard deviation and Mean of R, G and B in an image can be an important link 
to predict the similarities in two different images. Also no runtime calculations are 
required like in the process of correlation where the input image is correlated with the 
source image every time we need to find the correlation between two images. An image 
when fetched from Flickr website for the local database is divided into six equal small 
rectangles and then mean and standard deviation of these rectangles is saved in the 
application. The purpose of segmenting the image in six equal parts is to minimize the 
calculation done on each image segment and it also enhances the efficiency of results 
found as now each segment of an image is compared instead of the complete image 
which can lead to wrong results. This process is done on all the images in the local 
database and the standard deviation and mean values of the entire six segments are stored 
in the database for future calculations thus saving calculation time at runtime when user 
40 
 actually inputs an image to search related images from the database. The following lines 
of code perform this function in the application 
 
 
 
 
 
ResizeNearestNeighbor ^ filter = gcnew ResizeNearestNeighbor(210, 140); 
    bmp = filter->Apply(bmp); 
 
    Rectangle rect; 
    Bitmap ^ bmp1; 
 
    String ^ sd=""; 
    String ^ m=""; 
    for (int i=0;i<2;i++) 
    { 
     for (int j=0;j<3;j++) 
     { 
      rect= *gcnew Rectangle(j*70, i*70, 70, 70);  
 
      bmp1 = bmp-
>Clone(rect ,PixelFormat::Undefined); 
 
      ImageStatistics ^ stat = gcnew 
ImageStatistics(bmp1); 
       
      Histogram ^ red = stat->Red; 
      Histogram ^ green = stat->Green; 
      Histogram ^ blue = stat->Blue; 
 
      double avgd= (red->StdDev + green-
>StdDev + blue->StdDev)/3; 
      double avgm= (red->Mean + green->Mean 
+ blue->Mean)/3; 
 
      sd += avgd + ","; 
      
      m+= avgm +","; 
       
       
 
41 
       
     }      
    } 
When a user enters an image to search in the database, the same process is done on the 
image and nearest images with those properties is displayed to the user. The input image 
is divided into six segments and standard deviation and mean of R, G and B is calculated 
for all the six segments. The resultants values are then compared with the values stored in 
the database and nearest values are found using the K nearest (KNN) algorithm and 
Euclidean distance. The closest results are displayed to the user as outputs.

 description of image and the complete set of tags associated with the image. If the user 
presses the ‘Add to database’ button on Flickr form, the application automatically adds 
the top 2500 results returned by the Flickr website these results are not shown to the user 
and directly imported to the database. A total of 10000 images are currently imported in 
the local database. The images stored in the database are form different locations around 
the world which includes Pisa tower Italy, Eifel tower, Statue of liberty and Empire State 
Building.  
Limitations of the project are images stored in the database are very limited and about a 
very few different locations. Future work may include the learning of relationships 
between the tags and images to define sound algorithm for automatic annotation of 
images which will greatly help in image recognition processes and also improve the 
accuracy of results found related to images given by the user.

 6 EVALUATION 
The project was aimed at the formation of a system for the detection of images 
corresponding to the input tags or image data from the online resource for images and 
labels named Flickr. The previous methods for solving these problems considered only 
the image data and utilized the image processing algorithms for the computation of 
similar images in the online databases. This project was also intended to focus on the 
information stored in the metadata in the forms of tags that can help in detection of 
relevant similar images from the online image databases. 
The method developed for the implementation of the project contained algorithms from 
machine learning, image processing, artificial intelligence, and database management 
plus access. The algorithms were developed with the intention of computing similar data 
from the online resources with improved efficiency and accuracy. Almost all of the 
previous methods utilized graph-based search and walk-through to move through the 
related images but did not use image processing techniques. All of those researches were 
conducted on the data available from research institutes with the relationships developed 
between images already with probabilities defined by them, but the real-time applications 
are entirely different than those implementations. This project was developed by keeping 
in mind the real world applications, therefore no data has been extracted from research 
institutes rather complete information has been extracted from Flickr which makes this 
application salable in the market as well. 
The aim of the project was to implement image processing algorithms for the detection of 
similar images if the input data is an image, and to implementation machine learning and 
pattern recognition algorithms for the detection of similar images if the input data is in 
the form of tags. Both of the parts are implemented in the project with 100% accuracy as 
depicted by the results section that the correct images are found out every time. The 
project is developed for around 5 cities with around 10000 images but many further 
improvements will be required in algorithm design for the implementation for all the 
places around the world. The aims and objectives of the project have been achieved, and 
the implementation has been completely done with the help of Visual Studio, Aforge 
library, and Flickr API. 
6.1 Limitations 
There are some limitations in the product development in terms of the implementation of 
the project. The images stored in the database are around ten thousand images and they 
are of around 5 different places. The implementation of the project on a large scale needs 
53 
 a much bigger database of images which is hard to implement. The project is developed 
in Microsoft Access which limits the number of entries to eight thousand. So, there is a 
need to switch the application to other platforms for database management. The speed of 
the calculations needs to be increased when the database size would increase. The project 
is limited to do calculations completely via processor. The implementation of the image 
processing algorithms can be done on the graphical processing unit with the help of 
CUDA language to divide the processing between the processor and GPU for the sake of 
quickening up the speed and efficiency which will help to get over this limitation. 
Several limitations have been faced during the implementation of the project. The data 
has been extracted from the online website for photo sharing called as Flickr. There is no 
official application programming interface provided by the website for the extraction of 
data to the system via software. The only available application programming interfaces 
are made by the third-party without any documentation, and they are all made for the 
window based application. There is no API for .Net which was a limitation in the start. 
The API had to be converted completely to adjust to .Net framework for the extraction of 
data. 
Another limitation of the project is that the tags are uploaded with the image by normal 
people. So it is not necessary that the tags are relevant to the image, and sometimes they 
are completely irrelevant which causes limitations in the project. Algorithms need to be 
developed for extracting only the relevant tags and discarding the irrelevant tags. The 
project has also overcome this problem to a certain extent by giving probabilities to the 
tags but better and efficient algorithms still need to be developed. 
The image processing algorithms need to be fast because the time consumed in the 
searching of a huge database, and for comparing the image to all the images stored in the 
database is huge. Therefore, the image features of the images stored in the databases have 
been saved in the form of integers, but not all the features can be saved in this manner 
which causes a huge limitation in the project.

 6.2 Further research 
The mechanism developed for this particular project does not involve a supervised 
learning and training phase before stepping into the testing phase. The training phase is 
important in the implementation of the project in the domain of machine learning. The 
future researches in the field should focus on the development of algorithms that have a 
training set of data which improves the performance of the implementation by iterative 
methods. A cycle of testing and training phases should be repeated unless the required 
accuracy on a large scale is achieved. Iterative techniques of image annotation with the 
help of bi-relational graphs and probabilistic techniques are under development by certain 
scholars as depicted in the latest research paper regarding the field of machine learning. 
The probabilistic methods with the inclusion of Bayesian and k-nearest neighbor 
algorithms of pattern recognition, and the graph traversal algorithms with linkages 
between similar type of image and data classes can largely help in the process of 
detecting similar data from the online resources. The further research witnessed in this 
field has been quite low in efficiency, therefore the implementation of these latest 
researches by turning the execution of image processing algorithms to the graphics 
processing units instead of processors can help largely in terms of efficiency. Therefore, 
these changes should be considered in the designing of techniques and algorithms in the 
future researches for the annotation of unlabeled images. 
Image annotation for unlabeled images is an emerging topic for research. This research is 
normally focused on attaching tags to the unlabeled images. First of all, a graph is created 
for the image data set and then a graph is created for the class of labels. The labels in the 
graphs are associated with each other with certain probabilities and so are the images. 
After that, a bi-relational graph is created for the relations between the labels and the 
images. Whenever a new image data is arrived, the traversal through the graph is done 
from image data graph to the label graph on the basis of probabilistic modeling for the 
purpose of attaching labels with the images. This particular research time can give rise to 
a large number of important applications in the future; therefore a lot of research should 
be focused on the image annotation of the unlabeled images. The project developed in 
this report can provide the basis for conducting such researches to a large extent.

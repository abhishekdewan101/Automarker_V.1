ABSTRACT 
This project focuses on the implementation of an inexpensive autonomous Unmanned 
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system. By its nature, it requires two fundamental elements to 
operate, the aerial vehicle itself and a Ground Control Station (GCS) software. 
For the aerial vehicle, a quad rotor helicopter is built based on a design named 
Aeroquad [1]. It is a remote controlled quad copter with an embedded microcontroller 
and several sensors. Its software is open source making it cheap and flexible to modify. 
For the completion of this project, the open source software is integrated to a UAV 
featuring: 
? Autonomous navigation between different positions defined by the user 
? Communication link establishment with the GCS using an Internet  connection 
? Uninterruptable flight on communication link error events 
? Amendment of missions during flight 
On the other hand, GCS software is developed for the control and configuration of the 
UAV. This software successfully provides the user options to: 
? Calibrate the vehicle sensors 
? Configure the communication link 
? Plan the UAVÕs mission, 
? Track the vehicle on the globe in real time 
? View the current state of the UAVÕs orientation

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
UAVs were firstly and still being developed for military purposes such as covert 
reconnaissance, security and post disaster analysis. Over the past decade, UAVs demand 
have been grown exponentially when such a system stopped serving just military, but 
also civilian needs. They are nowadays found in a variety of fields. Geographic 
Information System (GIS) services are using UAVs for maps updating. They are also 
being used by environmental analysts for various observations and predictions. Some 
movie scenes were also taken by such vehicles. 
What it makes these systems more and more popular, is the reduced complexity of 
their flight control which can be achieved by a non-expert pilot. All the difficulties of 
controlling commands are now done by software enabling a user to fly them easily and 
securely.  Furthermore, vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) UAVs have a big advantage 
over the other types as they are commonly used in areas consisting of abrupt altitude 
changes such as inhabitant areas. Hence, rapid vertical climb or vertical decent is crucial. 
This project focuses on the implementation of a complete UAV system. It includes both 
the aerial vehicle software and hardware needs as well as the GCS platform. 
For the aerial vehicle, a low-cost remote controlled quad-rotor helicopter was 
used as it features stable flights [1]. The control software is open source and the 
computational unit is a microcontroller which can be programmed to meet the flight 
autonomy requirements. This also reduces its cost, which is a main constraint of the 
project.  
Within this project, a low cost remote controlled model is transformed into an 
efficient UAV able to navigate autonomously. Furthermore, the aircraft is able to 
navigate safely to its station in case of a communication link error. The communication 
between the aircraft and the ground control station is long ranged as the General Packet 
Radio Service (GPRS) was used.  
Consequently, a GCS application was developed. This application is responsible 
to initialize the aircraft by performing several pre-flight tasks. It also provides a user 
friendly environment for mission planning and is programmed to receive real-time 
information that is coming from the UAV. Last but not least, it visually tracks the 
aircraftÕs route on map while keep logs of the flight data for further analysis or 
simulation. 
 For the development of this project several areas were studied. These areas cover 
both software and hardware implementation needs. Sensor interfaces, communication 
link protocols and different technology availabilities were studied. Furthermore, 
mathematical models regarding the aircraft orientation have been analysed. Finally, the 
components should exist on a state-of-the-art ground control system application and the 
role of each was discovered and implemented in a way providing a user friendly 
interface.

Design of a PCB interfacing sensors with the microcontroller: 
 
The PCB design and implementation was a result of studying the sensors of the quad 
rotorÕs architecture [1]. It was then amended to a new design featuring all the required 
sensors to provide an autonomous flight such as: 
? 3 axis gyroscope for attitude calculations 
? 3 axis accelerometer for roll-pitch drift corrections 
? 3 axis magnetometer for autonomous navigation complementing Global 
Positioning SystemÕs (GPS). 
? GPS for autonomous navigation and yaw corrections 
? GPRS for communication 
 
Integration of the software able to receive and transmit data using GPRS service: 
 
The communication link between the microcontroller and the GPRS module has been 
implemented. The system is able to manipulate sockets for data transmission and 
reception. Furthermore, an application layer protocol between the aircraft and the GCS 
has been defined. A sample of such a protocol is presented in the ÒTheoretical 
Background on GCSÓ, found in chapter 3. The UAV is able to have a real time 
bidirectional communication link with the GCS over the Internet. The communication 
link is used for the real time amendment of the UAVÕs mission, as well as for the 
generation of the artificial instrumentation and tracking on the GCS. 
 
Integration of the software able to hold its altitude set by user: 
  
The aircraft makes use of the barometer to hold a user set altitude during navigation. As 
there is no low cost sensor to calculate altitude over ground, but both GPS and barometer 
measures altitude over sea level, it is left to the user to set a safe altitude for navigation. 
 
 
Integration of the software able to hold its position: 
 
Position hold is the ability of the aircraft to hover at the destination point by utilizing 
GPS. For the achievement of that objective an algorithm has been developed taking into 
account the inaccuracy of the positioning system as it is usually about a radius of 10-20 
meters. The algorithm stabilises the aircraft regardless any external force (such as wind) 
applied on the aircraft. The aircraft is designed to hold its position on the last position 
that exists in the mission list. However, a user can use the GCS-UAV communication to 
set any position he or she decides as last position.

Design of a ground control station modularized as observed in the theoretical 
background chapter 3 
The GCS software was developed in a visual object-oriented language. The software has 
mainly three views (modules), each one performing a role. These views are: 
? Mission planning 
? Flight Data 
? Configuration 
The GCS makes use of open source Google EarthÕs libraries for the virtual globe 
presentation. Asynchronous socket programming algorithms written for the 
communication link establishment and Serial Port programming were used for the wired 
communication with the vehicle for its configuration, initialization and calibration of pre-
flight procedures. 
Implementation of mission planning module: 
The mission planning view is user friendly environment where a user can design the 
desired missions for the aircraft to travel. The GCS makes use of open source Google 
EarthÕs libraries for the virtual globe presentation. The positions are placed by the user as 
ÔclicksÕ, are then converted to missions and are sent to the UAV.  
Implementation of flight data view of the UAV: 
The GCS tracks the position of the aircraft in real time. This is done by analysing the data 
sent from the UAV to the GCS. The data is visualised on the map not just as a dot, but as 
a moving arrow clarifying the UAVÕs orientation with respect to North. 
Implementation of artificial instrumentation of the UAV: 
The user, despite the tracking information is able to observe the current state of the 
vehicle in terms of its orientation. It is provided with information such as: number of 
satellites the GPS is listening from, the speed over ground and inertial information like 
pitch and roll angles with respect to level position. Last but not least, the user can view 
the azimuth of the aircraft.

2. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND ON UAVS 
 
Despite that the project can be characterised as an implementation project, several areas 
were studied for the implementation of each objective. This chapter is dedicated to the 
research made on the UAVs and especially the VTOL ones. It analyses the different 
approaches used to control the aircraftÕs orientation and stabilisation which are then used 
to develop the autopilot and the communication system. 
 
2.1.  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) 
 
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are characterised by small size and light weight [2]. They are 
also defined as unmanned (non-pilot) systems. Therefore, they make use of a wide 
variety of sensors to fill this absence in order to have stable and accurate flights. Due to 
their small size, multiple sensors and minimal space, they usually have some limitations, 
as most embedded systems do. These features and limitations in payload, size, power 
resources and computation power is what it needs to be balanced during the design of 
such a system. 
 Two main types of UAVs are available [3]; the rotary wing and fixed wing. Both 
of them have their advantages as well as some disadvantages. Fixed wing models feature 
less power consumption than rotary wing. On the other hand, they require enough 
distance for take-off and landing. Rotary wing models are also divided in two categories; 
the helicopters and multi-rotor helicopters (same axis Ð reverse rotation) with latter 
featuring simplified design but whatÕs more, stable flights.  
 Each aircraft (fixed-wing or rotary-wing) has three flight dynamic parameters 
known as pitch, roll and yaw as shown in Figure 1. These are basically three angles 
which are used to describe the orientation of the UAV at any given time.

? Ki (integral gain parameter) is used to eliminate the steady-state error but results 
in overshoot (signal oscillation around the Ôset pointÕ). The term is given in the 
form of: 
   ? ? ?? ??        Equation 2 
 and is effect is shown in Figure 5: 
 
 
 
Figure 5: The ÒIÓ parameter effect 
 
In a system with low Kp values (stable), the way Ki is affected is shown in Figure 5. The 
red line shows the response in the case the Ki gain selected is high. The system response 
is fast but also causes a large overshoot. Despite the large overshoot, the system 
stabilises on the Ôset pointÕ value. While the Ki gain decreases, the system response is 
slower but the stabilization is faster. 
 
? Kd (derivative parameter) is used to stabilise the system. This is the last term and 
its given by the formula: 
    ? ? ????? ? ?????      
 Equation 3 
 This term is used to calculate the rate of change error. If the rate of change of the 
 error is slow, the derivative gain term must be increased for the PID controller to 
 achieve a faster response. If the rate of change of the error is fast, then the 
 derivative gain term is decreased for the system to be stable.

DCM is applied on the aircraft as observed from [9] is described below: 
? For the pitch control of the aircraft, the current pitch angle must be known. This 
can be determined by calculating the dot product of the aircraftÕs roll axis with the 
earthÕs ÔyÕ. The direction cosine rzx is the dot product of the roll axis with the 
earthÕs ÔyÕ. However,  rzx is zero when the aircraft is in level position. 
? Similarly for the roll control, the current pitch must be known. This can be found 
by calculating the dot product of pitch axis with the earthÕs ÔyÕ. Furthermore, rzy 
can be found with the dot product of the pitch axis with earthÕs ÔyÕ. Again, rzy is 
zero when the aircraft is in level position. 
? The direction for navigation can be determined by the GPS course. Hence the yaw 
attitude is given by calculating the cross product of roll axis of the UAV with the 
desired direction vector. A test however must be made firstly to observe if the 
vehicle is not oriented opposite to its destination. That information is determined 
by calculating the dot product of the roll axis with the vector of the desired 
direction. That will give the course and if that is negative, the aircraft must rotate 
(yaw axis) more than 90 degrees to recover its correct orientation. 
 As the interest is focused on the horizontal components only, the z are set to zero, 
 therefore the vector is	???? ??? 0?. The cross product of this vector with the 
 direction wanted, gives the sine of the angle the aircraft is off course. 
? The vehicle is in reverse (upside down) if the dot product of yaw axis of the 
vehicle with vertical axis is negative. The dot product of the aircraftÕs yaw axis 
with the earthÕs ÔyÕ, will give the rzz of the matrix. If the aircraft is directed 
opposite it destination, a zero is obtained.  
? The rate of turning around the earthÕs ÔyÕ axis can be determined by the dot 
product of vertical axis with the gyroscope rotation vector. Therefore the rate of 
the rotation of the aircraft around the earthÕs y can be obtained by calculating 
?xrzx + ?yrzy + ?z rzz. 
 
In other words, assuming the DCM is updated by the gyroscope, accelerometer and 
magnetometer sensors correctly, the following matrix is computed: 
 
?? ? ?
???????? ????????? ???????
???????????????????????? ??????????????????? ????????????????????
??????? ????????????? ?????????????
?Equation 6  
 
Hence, the current orientation angles can be determined as: 
 
? ROLL =  atan2(?????????????, ?????????????); 
? PITCH =  -asin(Gravity); 
? YAW =  atan2(????????????????????????,	????????);

2.4.3.1.1 NMEA Checksum Calculation/Validation 
 
The way the NMEA sentences are checked against corruptions is the checksum value at 
the end of each sentence. The algorithm for validating the sentences is by performing an 
XOR between all bytes which exist between the Ô$Õ sign and the Ô*Õ sign. 
 
A sample C code for calculating the checksum is: 
 
int CheckSum(char *sentence) { 
int i; 
int res=0; 
int c; 
 for (i = 0; i < strlen(string); i++) { 
  c = (unsigned char)string[i]; 
  if (c == '*') break; 
  if (c != '$') res ^= c; 
 } 
return res; 
}

2.5.  Wireless Communication 
 
Most common types of communication media found on small UAVs are the wireless 
802.11x and RF technologies [16]. These types of communication provide a high rate of 
data transfer as well as reliability in terms of successful transmit/receive of data. As the 
payload of the UAVs is limited, the communication equipment they can carry has to be 
limited in weight; as a result the effective range of communication between the ground 
control stations is restricted to several miles.  
 The communication between the UAV and the ground control station has to be 
bidirectional. The ground station is sending navigation orders while the vehicle is sending 
flight data back to the ground station. For this reason wireless communication media are 
used such as Wi-Fi which features the reliable TCP/IP protocol [16]. 
Another wireless communication media is the GPRS/3G which is a GSM service 
[17]. It uses the GSM cellular network to exchange reliable data using TCP/IP transport 
layer protocol. All well-known application layer protocols such as HTTP, POP3, FTP etc. 
are working on top of it.

3.1 Tasks and Instrumentation of a Ground Control Station 
 
The user should be able to plan a mission by specifying the coordinates of each 
destination as well as the priority of each. The system is also responsible to perform the 
pre-flight checks before proceeding to the take-off action [18]. During the flight the user 
is monitoring the aircraftÕs orientation as well as the mission progress. That is achieved 
soon as the GCS is continuously transforms the data are coming from the UAV to 
artificial instruments. This instrumentation helps a user to have notion of the flight status.  
The main instruments should exist on a ground control station are: 
? Real time GPS Information 
? Altimeter 
? Artificial horizon / Head-Up Display (HUD) is shown in Figure 11 
? Battery/Fuel status 
? Speed over ground 
? Air speed 
 
Figure 11: A sample HUD for visualization of flight data [19] 
The GPS information are available within a GCS is used for the determination of the 
current position of the aircraft with respect to its destination. Hence, the UAV can be 
tracked on a map. The HUD displayed in Figure 11 is used for the determination of 
aircraftÕs orientation. This information combined with the current positioning information

The information sent from the aircraft has to be encoded in a packet. This packet should 
have an overhead containing a Ôstart-of-messageÕ field, Ôthe packet lengthÕ and ÔtypeÕ. 
Then the significant information follows depending on type: 
 
? Main flight information: 
 
a. GPS position 
b. Speed over ground 
c. Course over ground 
d. Altitude 
e. Compass measurement 
f. Horizon information 
 
? Secondary flight information 
 
g. Battery level 
h. Number of GPS satellites connected to 
i. GPS signal lock indication (GPS fix) 
 
Apart from that, the GCS provides video streaming for surveillance. The streaming 
information might be sent either through the communication link or by a dedicated 
remote long-distance surveillance unit. In both cases, the GCS is responsible to combine 
the video information with artificial instrumentation discussed in chapter 3.1 Tasks 
and Instrumentation of a Ground Control Station.

Figure 16: The new PCB designed 
The layout of the new PCB (Appendix chapter 9.2) is shown in Figure 16. It fits on top 
(orange rectangles) of the microcontroller shown in Figure 14 interconnecting all the 
sensors shown by different colour rectangles with the microcontroller. The cyan shape 
shows the power supply designed for powering the GPS/GPRS module which works on 
different voltage levels compared to the sensors and the microcontroller. 
 All the remaining sensors (barometer, accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer), 
are connected to the microcontroller using the I2C interface. The way the protocol works

the control circuit. The ESCs inputs are the battery and the PWM outputs of the 
microcontroller. Their outputs are connected to the motors as shown in the Figure 13 
block diagram. The Control circuit is divided into two levels. The microcontroller 
evaluation board is installed at the bottom while the PCB with the required sensors is 
attached on top of it. The GPS antenna is installed on the top of the cover as it requires 
light-of-sight view with the sky for better signal reception. The GSM antenna is mounted 
as far as possible form the electronic components because various tests showed that 
interferes with a sensor. Last but not least, the USB port mentioned provides access to the 
microcontroller for programming, debugging but what is more, wired connectivity with 
the GCS for pre-flight configuration and wireless communication initialisation. 
4.2 The UAV Software 
 
The software of the UAV developed performs two tasks. At first, it enables the vehicle to 
navigate itself (autopilot) while the same time enables wireless connectivity with the 
GCS platform through internet.  
 
 
Figure 18: The Block diagram of the open source software already exists [1] 
Figure 18 represents the structure of the software the quad rotor vehicle use for the RC 
navigation [1]. After the study of the software, several observations were made about the 
navigation control lead to the solution approach: 
 
? There is a DCM filled with data of all sensors as described in ÒTheoretical 
background on UAVsÓ chapter 2.4.2. 
? There is a PID controller for each angle of the aircraft dynamics (pitch, roll and 
yaw).  
Stefanos Constantinou, Advanced Microelectronic Systems Engineering, 2011   37 
 
? A PID controller update function exists which takes three parameters to update 
the aircraftÕs orientation: the Òset pointÓ, the Òcurrent dataÓ and a pointer to the 
object describing each angle (this object contains information such as P, I, and D 
gain parameters described in chapter 2.3.1). 
? The Òset pointÓ of each PID controller is the transmitterÕs input. 
? The Òcurrent dataÓ of each PID controller can be maintained by the DCM: 
o For the ROLL =  atan2(?????????????, ?????????????); 
o For the PITCH =  -asin(Gravity); 
o For the YAW =  atan2(????????????????????????,	????????); 
? There is a function takes the PID controllersÕ output and generates motor 
commands. 
? The control loop runs at 100Hz (10ms update rate). 
 
The following statement is an abstract approach of what made for the autonomous 
navigation of the aircraft: 
 
The ideal algorithm for autonomous navigation should use the GPS data and the 
magnetometer readings in a way imitating the transmitter inputs which are currently 
assumed by the software as Òset pointsÓ for the three PID controllers already exist. 
 
Hence, an abstract block diagram of the modified flight software is presented in Figure 
19. The data are sent to the internet, as shown will be delivered to the GCS for 
processing. The procedure is discussed in chapter 4.3.

centimeters as the earth is an ellipsoid object (WGS84 ellipsoid parameters) 
enabling the trigonometry functions to be applied. 
? The inverse tangent of the two differences results the angle to destination (? 
angle): ?=atan2(LongitudeDiff,LatitudeDiff). 
 
The subtraction ?-? gives the Òtarget angleÓ which will be used as the Òset pointÓ for the 
PID controller updates (both pitch and roll) such as: 
 The sine of the target angle is the Òset pointÓ for the rollÕs PID controller while 
the cosine of the target angle is the Òset pointÓ of the pitchÕs PID controller.  
During the calculation of the Òset pointÓ, another variable calculated is the distance to 
destination. This is easily maintained by the use of the differences already calculated. The 
Pythagorean Theorem is applied for the distance calculation. c2 = a2 + b2 where ÔaÕ is the 
LongitudeDiff and ÔbÕ is the LatitudeDiff. 
As the Òset pointsÓ are determined, the Òcurrent dataÓ is the second parameter the PID 
controller requires. For the determination of this, two consecutive samples from the GPS 
data are required. This is the previous coordinate position (longitude, latitude) and the 
current position. A similar procedure is applied for the calculation as before: 
? Subtraction of the current Longitude read by GPS from the very previous 
Longitude read depending on the GPS rate (PreviousLongitude - 
CurrentLongitude). Note: for the Òcurrent dataÓ calculation the Previous 
Longitude is used instead of the destinationÕs Longitude.  
? Subtraction of the current Latitude read of GPS from the very previous Latitude 
read depending on the GPS rate (PreviousLatitude - CurrentLatitude). Note: for 
the Òcurrent dataÓ calculation the Previous Latitude is used instead of the 
destinationÕs Latitude.  
? The inverse tangent of the two differences is the trajectory deviation angle (? 
angle) which is effectively the error parameter of the PID controller: 
?=atan2(LongitudeDiff,LatitudeDiff) 
The subtraction ?-? gives the Òtarget angleÓ will be used as the Òcurrent dataÓ for the PID 
controller updates (both pitch and roll). 
 What effectively is achieved here is the correction of the GPS deviation affecting 
the trajectory of the aircraft to the destination. This attempts to correct these errors 
because the calculation of the Òtarget angleÓ is a result of both GPS and magnetometer 
readings (?-?, where ? is the azimuth obtained by the magnetometer). As the 
magnetometerÕs update rate is really high compared to the GPSÕs (100Hz versus 1Hz) the 
GPS errors are ÒsmoothedÓ by the PID controller because the magnetometer provides fast 
and accurate corrections.

Thus, the next test made was to bring the vehicle to the destination position and observe 
its response. This test was made to verify the position hold functionality of the algorithm 
as well as the determination of a reached position. When the vehicle placed to the 
destination, the response on the motors was remarkable. The motors Òfront-leftÓ and 
Òback-leftÓ decreased their speeds. However, all the motors were not spinning at the same 
speed. That is because the inaccuracy of the GPS. For the confirmation that the GPS 
inaccuracy has resulted this response, the vehicle moved eastern than the destination 
position. The results obtained were as expected. The Òfront-leftÓ and Òback-leftÓ motors 
decreased their speeds while the Òfront-rightÓ and Óback-rightÓ motor speeds were 
increased to bring it back to the destination. A drawback recognised is the low GPS rate. 
As soon as the navigation between positions operates correctly (which includes the 
magnetometer readings for the trajectory following), the main reason the destination is 
delayed to marked as reached is the GPS rate. 
 
Autonomous navigation algorithm result synopsis: 
? The autonomous navigation algorithm has proven to function correct as soon as it 
calculates the required roll and pitch angles 
? The position hold feature proven to work as it can hold the vehicle in a radius of 
about 15 meters to destination 
? There is lag of the algorithm for detecting immediately that the destination is 
reached. That is due to the low GPS refresh rate.

5.3.  Communication Link Tests 
 
The way the communication link verified was by testing each side individually for both 
inbound and outbound data transfer. At first, an infinite loop was created on the 
microcontroller board that was generating random data. The data was in the form of 
messages the GCS understands and presents. At the same time, the microcontroller was 
connected to the computer via the serial port (USB). The messages were sent through the 
internet (outbound network socket) connection were repeated on the serial 
communication link. A telnet client as well a serial line client was used to log both 
incoming transmissions. After certain time has elapsed, both log files were compared for 
any data misses or corrupts assuming as valid data the data received through the wired 
transmission. The results showed that every byte was sent over the internet were received 
correctly and in order. 
 For the inbound transmission verification, a similar concept applied. The 
difference was that the infinite loop on the microcontroller used to read from the internet 
link (network socket) and then repeat them to the serial line. The data received from the 
serial line were compared with the original data was sent from the computerÕs outbound 
internet connection. Again there were not any corruptions or data misses. Identical 
procedure applied to verify the GCS communication link. 
 After the individual verification tests were completed, the communication link 
was tested while the autonomous navigation algorithm was running. The serial 
communication kept active to validate the transferred mission plans and mission 
amendments. Succeed transmission of data was resulted. 
 However, tests showed that the GSM antenna interferes with a component is 
installed on the PCB. For this reason the antenna moved as far as possible from the 
electronics. 
  
5.4. GCS Functionality Tests 
 
Once the GCS developed the functionality tests taken place was through the internet and 
serial communication lines the software relies on. A telnet client was used to imitate the 
UAV in terms of data transmission through internet. Random data were sent and the 
transmission rate was faster than the GPRS usually handles. That ensured the memory 
allocated successful as there was not failures after certain time has elapsed. That also 
ensures that the GCS can be used with a UAV transmits over a faster communication 
link. 
 Furthermore, the GCS tested for any possible failures on invalid data 
transmissions. The GCS proven to reject any messages are not formatted as it could. 
Finally the GCS verified that generates messages which the UAV can understand and 
decode as discussed in sub-chapter 0.

6. EVALUATION 
 
The project had three main objectives. These were the integration of the remote 
controlled quad rotor helicopter to an autonomous vehicle, the generation of the GCS 
software as well as the communication link between them. 
 The integration of the software to a UAV objective was achieved, as soon as the 
UAV can travel through different positions and hold its position (hovers) for surveillance. 
However, automatic take-off and landing procedures are not yet functional and a RC 
transmitter is still required. There were two main reasons affected this objective. The first 
was the minimal time remained for software developing after the hardware assembly of 
the aircraft. Apart from that, the PCB was defective. A lot of time spent for the 
determination of whether was a PCB design error or due to a hardware component 
failure. Finally, the problem proven to be a manufacture error as there was resistance in 
the thru-hole vias. 
 On the other hand, the GCS application developed achieved all of its objectives. 
These are the three operational views have been described in chapter 4.3 (configuration, 
mission planning and flight data representation).  
 Furthermore, the communication link objective achieved as there is a bidirectional 
communication between the UAV and the GCS. The drawback of the communication 
link is its speed, but it was the only available solution featured long-range 
communication with minimal size and weight. In addition, GSM, which the GPRS relies 
on, is widely available in inhabitant areas where the project targets on as application 
environment.

7. FUTURE WORK 
 
Regarding the improvements would be made on the current project; the GPS receiver 
could be replaced with one that offering better update rates. Such receivers are now 
available at low cost. Thus, the issue of delayed determination of a reached position will 
be solved.  
 Furthermore, a new version of the remote controlled quad rotor software has been 
released. According to the description, the Òaltitude holdÓ algorithm became reliable. 
Hence, the modifications have been made on this project can be transferred to the new 
version of the software. As a result, the automatic take-off and landing functionality can 
be integrated there.  
 On the other hand, the GCS software can be improved by an algorithm predicts 
the trajectory of the UAV on the globe. As soon as the GCS software already obtains 
altitude information for a specified position, the trajectory prediction algorithm can be 
used to inform the UAV to change its altitude to avoid obstacles. 
 A worthy improvement of the project could be the replacement of the 16MHz 
microcontroller with a faster microprocessor or a digital signal processor. Such 
improvement will increase the stability of flight. Moreover, new functions that require 
further processing resources can be implemented.
